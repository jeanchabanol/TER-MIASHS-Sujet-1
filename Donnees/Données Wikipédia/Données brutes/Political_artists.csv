He had residencies with Stedelijk Museum between 2013 and 2014 and at the Thiami Mnyele Artists' Residency in Amsterdam .  He is a lecturer at the College of Art and Built Environment ,  Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology .   "
823,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Leon_Battista_Alberti,Leon_Battista_Alberti,Artist_authors," Leon Battista Alberti was born in 1404 in Genoa .  His mother was Bianca Fieschi .  His father ,  Benedetto Alberti ,  was a wealthy Florentine who had been exiled from his own city ,  but allowed to return in 1428 .  Alberti was sent to boarding school in Padua ,  then studied law at Bologna . Alberti was gifted in many ways .  He was tall ,  strong ,  and a fine athlete who could ride the wildest horse and jump over a person's head . In 1438 he began to focus more on architecture and was encouraged by the Marchese Leonello d'Este of Ferrara ,  for whom he built a small triumphal arch to support an equestrian statue of Leonello's father . His first major architectural commission was in 1446 for the facade of the Rucellai Palace in Florence .  This was followed in 1450 by a commission from Sigismondo Malatesta to transform the Gothic church of San Francesco in Rimini into a memorial chapel ,  the Tempio Malatestiano .  Alberti's only known sculpture is a self-portrait medallion ,  sometimes attributed to Pisanello . Alberti was employed to design two churches in Mantua ,  San Sebastiano ,  which was never completed and for which Alberti's intention can only be speculated upon ,  and the Basilica of Sant'Andrea .  The design for the latter church was completed in 1471 ,  a year before Alberti's death ,  but was brought to completion and is his most significant work . As an artist ,  Alberti distinguished himself from the ordinary craftsman educated in workshops .  He was a humanist who followed Aristotle and Plotinus ,  and part of the rapidly expanding entourage of intellectuals and artisans supported by the courts of the princes and lords of the time .  As a member of noble family and as part of the Roman curia ,  Alberti had special status .  He was a welcomed guest at the Este court in Ferrara ,  and in Urbino he spent part of the hot-weather season with the soldier-prince Federico III da Montefeltro .  The Duke of Urbino was a shrewd military commander ,  who generously spent money on the patronage of art .  Alberti planned to dedicate his treatise on architecture to his friend . Among Alberti's smaller studies ,  pioneering in their field ,  were a treatise in cryptography ,  De componendis cifris ,  and the first Italian grammar .  With the Florentine cosmographer Paolo Toscanelli he collaborated in astronomy ,  a close science to geography at that time ,  and he produced a small Latin work on geography ,  Descriptio urbis Romae (The Panorama of the City of Rome) .  Just a few years before his death ,  Alberti completed De iciarchia (On Ruling the Household) ,  a dialogue about Florence during the Medici rule . Having taken holy orders ,  Alberti never married .  He loved animals and had a pet dog ,  a mongrel ,  for whom he wrote a panegyric ,  (Canis) .  Alberti died in Rome on 25 April 1472 at the age of 68 .     "
824,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Larry_D._Alexander,Larry_D._Alexander,Artist_authors,"  Born in the small rural town of Dermott ,  Arkansas to Robert and Janie Alexander ,  Larry is the fourth of ten children and the second of the union of his parents .   His father was a truck driver ,  and his mother was a beautician .  Alexander began drawing at about the age of four .  He never received any formal art training during any level of his schooling while growing up ,  as none was available in his small rural hometown .  After graduating from Dermott High School in May 1971 ,  Alexander moved to Pine Bluff ,  Arkansas ,  where he studied Architectural Residential Design at Pines Vocational Technical School ,  now Southeast Arkansas College .  In later years he also attended Richland College in Dallas ,  Texas where he studied AutoCAD . Today ,  six pieces of his work from his popular ""Dermott Series"" ,  a series of paintings he painted about his childhood home of Dermott ,  are now a part of the permanent collection at the Arts and Science Center for Southeast Arkansas in Pine Bluff ,  Arkansas .  Alexander's work is mostly influenced by his experiences in life ,  such as growing up in the rural south during the 1950s and 1960s ,  as well as his life in Detroit ,  Michigan during the 1970s and 1980s . Alexander moved to Detroit ,  Michigan after two years of school in Pine Bluff to seek employment in his chosen field .  However ,  he was unsuccessful in the short run ,  and instead ,  he ended up finding work in a Chrysler auto assembly plant and became fascinated with the innerworkings of cars .  This led him to become a certified mechanic ,  a craft he worked at for the next seventeen years .  He ultimately met and married his wife ,  Patricia while living in Detroit ,  and they moved their family to Irving ,  Texas where he opened his own auto repair shop and operated it until 1991 . Encouraged by Patricia ,  he began using his art talent for the first time in fifteen years .  His career as a professional artist can be traced back to this point as he developed his ""pen and ink"" style that he calls ""crosshatching"" ,  and used it to create several lines of greeting cards under his ,  now defunct ,  ""Alexander Greeting Cards Company"" name .  He coined the phrase ""The Expressions Line"" for his first line of greeting cards in 1991 ,  but did not trademark the name .  As a result ,  Hallmark Cards now has used the name on a line of their cards since 1997 .  His line should not be confused or associated with their product line . Alexander is also a ""realist painter"" who works in a variety of other mediums including oils ,  acrylics ,  and watercolors .  He is a self-taught artist who chooses mostly to do exhibits in venues that provide mainstream exposure to a large variety of people such as festivals ,  schools ,  malls ,  libraries ,  banks ,  art institutions ,  and even U . S .  Post Office branches on occasion . In early 1996 Alexander finished and released his popular ""Dermott Series"" ,  a 20 piece collection of oil and acrylic paintings that offered a nostalgic look back at his childhood of growing up in rural southeast Arkansas .  The paintings feature images of people ,  buildings ,  and sites of Dermott ,  Arkansas ,  such as a cotton gin ,  his childhood house ,  where he went to school ,  and other images .  Alexander said at the time that ,  ""I did the Dermott Series for many personal reasons ,  and I'm overwhelmed by the response this collection is creating here in Texas"" .  The series includes ,  ""Birthplace"" ,  ""Where I grew up"" ,  ""Picking Cotton"" ,  ""Cotton Gin"" ,  ""Hot Grits"" ,  ""In the kitchen with mama"" ,  and the old Chicot County High School ,  among others . In 1999 Alexander unveiled his ""Detroit Series"" ,  a series of oil and acrylic paintings of various sites in Detroit ,  Michigan at the American Black Artist Institute on West Grand Boulevard in Detroit .  The nine piece series includes paintings on Belle Isle Park ,  the Detroit skyline ,  the Detroit River ,  Hitsville USA (the original home for Motown Records) ,  Greektown Historic District ,  the old Tiger Stadium (Detroit) ,  the old J . L .  Hudson building ,  former mayor Coleman A .  Young ,  and many more . In May 1998 Alexander unveiled his ""Delta Series ,  which was painted entirely with acrylics ,  during ""the Arkansas Schools Tours"" .  The tour was expanded that year to include stops in Greenville ,  Mississippi ,  and Memphis ,  Tennessee .  This series included paintings of the Mississippi Alluvial Plain region from Monroe ,  Louisiana ,  to Memphis .  It includes a painting of Graceland ,  Elvis Presley's former home ,  the landmark Greenville Courthouse in Greenville ,  a perspective of Beale Street in Memphis ,  and his classic rendition of a ""Cotton Farm"" ,  among other subjects .  Another piece from the Delta Series ,  ""Aunt Eira Mae"" ,  was donated to the permanent collection of the African American Museum (Dallas ,  Texas) ,  in 2004 . Alexander has also donated work to art departments of schools and colleges .  In October 1996 at halftime at the inaugural football game ,  billed as the ""Mobil Gridiron Classic"" ,  at Texas Stadium in Irving ,  Texas ,  Alexander presented a piece from one of his series ,  ""The series of P . A . T . R . I . C . E"" ,  to the president ,  and the chancellor ,  of the participating colleges ,  respectively ,  Texas Southern University and the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff . Alexander's most popular Pen and Ink art series ,  ""The Sixties Series"" has been exhibited in schools ,  libraries ,  and art institutions in several places since it was completed in 1993 .  It consists of elaborate drawings of well known figures and events of the 1960s ,  such as the civil rights Selma to Montgomery marches of 1965 ,  and portraits of Martin Luther King Jr .  ,  Lyndon Johnson ,  Malcolm X ,  Medgar Evers ,  and Rosa Parks .  This series also covers the Vietnam War . The theme pieces in the collection are a piece called ""Composite Sixties"" ,  and one called ""Composite Protests"" ,  which make up a composite of people ,  places and events that were prominent in the 1960s .  For example ,  they show images of John F .  Kennedy ,  Lyndon Johnson ,  and Richard M .  Nixon ,  the United States presidents who served during the sixties ,  also J .  Edgar Hoover ,  Jackie Kennedy ,  Ted Kennedy ,  Robert F .  Kennedy ,  an image of U . S .  astronauts landing on the moon in 1969 ,  and many of the American protests that took place during this turbulent decade ,  to name a few .    "

830,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/William_Blake,William_Blake,Artist_authors," William Blake was born on 28 November 1757 at 28 Broad Street (now Broadwick St . ) in Soho ,  London .  He was the third of seven children ,  The Bible was an early and profound influence on Blake ,  and remained a source of inspiration throughout his life . Blake started engraving copies of drawings of Greek antiquities purchased for him by his father ,  a practice that was preferred to actual drawing .  Within these drawings Blake found his first exposure to classical forms through the work of Raphael ,  Michelangelo ,  Maarten van Heemskerck and Albrecht Dürer .  The number of prints and bound books that James and Catherine were able to purchase for young William suggests that the Blakes enjoyed ,  at least for a time ,  a comfortable wealth .  He read avidly on subjects of his own choosing .  During this period ,  Blake made explorations into poetry ;  his early work displays knowledge of Ben Jonson ,  Edmund Spenser ,  and the Psalms . On 4 August 1772 ,  Blake was apprenticed to engraver James Basire of Great Queen Street ,  at the sum of £52 . 10 ,  for a term of seven years . After two years ,  Basire sent his apprentice to copy images from the Gothic churches in London (perhaps to settle a quarrel between Blake and James Parker ,  his fellow apprentice) .  His experiences in Westminster Abbey helped form his artistic style and ideas .  The Abbey of his day was decorated with suits of armour ,  painted funeral effigies and varicoloured waxworks .  Ackroyd notes that "" .  .  . the most immediate On 8 October 1779 ,  Blake became a student at the Royal Academy in Old Somerset House ,  near the Strand .  Blake also disliked Reynolds' apparent humility ,  which he held to be a form of hypocrisy .  Against Reynolds' fashionable oil painting ,  Blake preferred the Classical precision of his early influences ,  Michelangelo and Raphael . David Bindman suggests that Blake's antagonism towards Reynolds arose not so much from the president's opinions (like Blake ,  Reynolds held history painting to be of greater value than landscape and portraiture) ,  but rather ""against his hypocrisy in not putting his ideals into practice . "" Certainly Blake was not averse to exhibiting at the Royal Academy ,  submitting works on six occasions between 1780 and 1808 . Blake became a friend of John Flaxman ,  Thomas Stothard and George Cumberland during his first year at the Royal Academy .  They shared radical views ,  with Stothard and Cumberland joining the Society for Constitutional Information . Blake's first biographer ,  Alexander Gilchrist ,  records that in June 1780 Blake was walking towards Basire's shop in Great Queen Street when he was swept up by a rampaging mob that stormed Newgate Prison .  The mob attacked the prison gates with shovels and pickaxes ,  set the building ablaze ,  and released the prisoners inside .  Blake was reportedly in the front rank of the mob during the attack .  The riots ,  in response to a parliamentary bill revoking sanctions against Roman Catholicism ,  became known as the Gordon Riots and provoked a flurry of legislation from the government of George III ,  and the creation of the first police force .   Blake met Catherine Boucher in 1782 when he was recovering from a relationship that had culminated in a refusal of his marriage proposal .  He recounted the story of his heartbreak for Catherine and her parents ,  after which he asked Catherine ,  ""Do you pity me?"" When she responded affirmatively ,  he declared ,  ""Then I love you . "" Blake married Catherine – who was five years his junior – on 18 August 1782 in St Mary's Church ,  Battersea .  Illiterate ,  Catherine signed her wedding contract with an X .  The original wedding certificate may be viewed at the church ,  where a commemorative stained-glass window was installed between 1976 and 1982 .  Later ,  in addition to teaching Catherine to read and write ,  Blake trained her as an engraver .  Throughout his life she proved a valuable aid ,  helping to print his illuminated works and maintaining his spirits throughout numerous misfortunes . Blake's first collection of poems ,  Poetical Sketches ,  was printed around 1783 .  early feminist Mary Wollstonecraft and English revolutionary Thomas Paine .  Along with William Wordsworth and William Godwin ,  Blake had great hopes for the French and American revolutions and wore a Phrygian cap in solidarity with the French revolutionaries ,  but despaired with the rise of Robespierre and the Reign of Terror in France .  In 1784 Blake composed his unfinished manuscript An Island in the Moon . Blake illustrated Original Stories from Real Life (2nd edition ,  1791) by Mary Wollstonecraft .  They seem to have shared some views on sexual equality and the institution of marriage ,  but there is no evidence proving that they met .  In 1793's Visions of the Daughters of Albion ,  Blake condemned the cruel absurdity of enforced chastity and marriage without love and defended the right of women to complete self-fulfilment . From 1790 to 1800 ,  William Blake lived in North Lambeth ,  London ,  at 13 Hercules Buildings ,  Hercules Road . In 1788 ,  aged 31 ,  Blake experimented with relief etching ,  a method he used to produce most of his books ,  paintings ,  pamphlets and poems .  The process is also referred to as illuminated printing ,  and the finished products as illuminated books or prints .  Illuminated printing involved writing the text of the poems on copper plates with pens and brushes ,  using an acid-resistant medium .  Illustrations could appear alongside words in the manner of earlier illuminated manuscripts .  He then etched the plates in acid to dissolve the untreated copper and leave the design standing in relief (hence the name) . This is a reversal of the usual method of etching ,  where the lines of the design are exposed to the acid ,  and the plate printed by the intaglio method .  Relief etching (which Blake referred to as ""stereotype"" in The Ghost of Abel) was intended as a means for producing his illuminated books more quickly than via intaglio .  Stereotype ,  a process invented in 1725 ,  consisted of making a metal cast from a wood engraving ,  but Blake's innovation was ,  as described above ,  very different .  The pages printed from these plates were hand-coloured in watercolours and stitched together to form a volume .  Blake used illuminated printing for most of his well-known works ,  including Songs of Innocence and of Experience ,  The Book of Thel ,  The Marriage of Heaven and Hell and Jerusalem . Although Blake has become better known for his relief etching ,  his commercial work largely consisted of intaglio engraving ,  the standard process of engraving in the 18th century in which the artist incised an image into the copper plate ,  a complex and laborious process ,  with plates taking months or years to complete ,  but as Blake's contemporary ,  John Boydell ,  realised ,  such engraving offered a ""missing link with commerce"" ,  enabling artists to connect with a mass audience and became an immensely important activity by the end of the 18th century . Europe Supported by Africa and America is an engraving by Blake held in the collection of the University of Arizona Museum of Art .  The engraving was for a book written by Blake's friend John Gabriel Stedman called The Narrative of a Five Years Expedition against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam (1796) . Blake employed intaglio engraving in his own work ,  such as for his Illustrations of the Book of Job ,  completed just before his death .  Most critical work has concentrated on Blake's relief etching as a technique because it is the most innovative aspect of his art ,  but a 2009 study drew attention to Blake's surviving plates ,  including those for the Book of Job :  they demonstrate that he made frequent use of a technique known as ""repoussage"" ,  a means of obliterating mistakes by hammering them out by hitting the back of the plate .  Such techniques ,  typical of engraving work of the time ,  are very different from the much faster and fluid way of drawing on a plate that Blake employed for his relief etching ,  and indicates why the engravings took so long to complete .

From 1769–85 he was an insurance clerk with the Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation .  In 1772 he also attended the Royal Academy Schools and exhibited at the Academy in 1782 and 1783 ,  but failed to be elected an Associate in 1784 . Along with John Flaxman and Thomas Stothard ,  Cumberland joined the social circle of William Blake within a year of Blake becoming a student at the Royal Academy Schools in 1779 . Cumberland was to be a lifelong friend and supporter of Blake .  As early as 1780 a contribution by Cumberland to the Morning Chronicle praised Blake's first exhibit at the Academy ,  the watercolour The Death of EarlGoodwin . Cumberland shared an interest with Blake in printmaking .  In 1784 they both experimented with new methods of printing etched texts .     "
838,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_Delacroix,Eugène_Delacroix,Artist_authors," Eugène Delacroix was born on 26 April 1798 at Charenton-Saint-Maurice in Île-de-France ,  near Paris .  His mother was named Victoire Oeben ,  the daughter of the cabinet-maker Jean-François Oeben . He had three much older siblings . Charles-Henri Delacroix (1779–1845) rose to the rank of General in the Napoleonic army . Henriette (1780–1827) married the diplomat Raymond de Verninac Saint-Maur (1762–1822) . Henri was born six years later .  He was killed at the Battle of Friedland on 14 June 1807 . There are medical reasons to believe that Eugène's legitimate father ,  Charles-François Delacroix ,  was not able to procreate at the time of Eugène's conception . Talleyrand ,  who was a friend of the family and successor of Charles Delacroix as Minister of Foreign Affairs ,  and whom the adult Eugène resembled in appearance and character ,  considered himself as his real father .  Throughout his career as a painter ,  he was protected by Talleyrand ,  who served successively the Restoration and king Louis-Philippe ,  and ultimately as ambassador of France in Great Britain ,  and later by Charles Auguste Louis Joseph ,  duc de Morny ,  half-brother of Napoleon III and speaker of the French House of Commons .  His legitimate father ,  Charles Delacroix ,  died in 1805 ,  and his mother in 1814 ,  leaving 16-year-old Eugène an orphan . His early education was at the Lycée Louis-le-Grand ,  and at the Lycée Pierre Corneille in Rouen It precedes the influence of the more colourful and rich style of the Flemish Baroque painter Peter Paul Rubens ,  and fellow French artist Théodore Géricault ,  whose works marked an introduction to Romanticism in art . The impact of Géricault's The Raft of the Medusa was profound ,  and stimulated Delacroix to produce his first major painting ,  The Barque of Dante ,  which was accepted by the Paris Salon in 1822 .  The work caused a sensation ,  and was largely derided by the public and officialdom ,  yet was purchased by the State for the Luxembourg Galleries ;  the pattern of widespread opposition to his work ,  countered by a vigorous ,  enlightened support ,  would continue throughout his life .  Two years later he again achieved popular success for his The Massacre at Chios .   Delacroix's painting of the massacre at Chios shows sick ,  dying Greek civilians about to be slaughtered by the Turks .  One of several paintings he made of this contemporary event ,  expressed the official policy for the Greek cause in their war of independence against the Turks ,  war sustained by English ,  Russian and French governments .  Delacroix was quickly recognized by the authorities as a leading painter in the new Romantic style ,  and the picture was bought by the state .  His depiction of suffering was controversial ,  however ,  as there was no glorious event taking place ,  no patriots raising their swords in valour as in David's Oath of the Horatii ,  only a disaster .  Many critics deplored the painting's despairing tone ;  the artist Antoine-Jean Gros called it ""a massacre of art"" . Delacroix produced a second painting in support of the Greeks in their war for independence ,  this time referring to the capture of Missolonghi by Turkish forces in 1825 . A trip to England in 1825 included visits to Thomas Lawrence and Richard Parkes Bonington ,  and the colour and handling of English painting provided impetus for his only full-length portrait ,  the elegant Portrait of Louis-Auguste Schwiter (1826–30) .  At roughly the same time ,  Delacroix was creating romantic works of numerous themes ,  many of which would continue to interest him for over thirty years .  By 1825 ,  he was producing lithographs illustrating Shakespeare ,  and soon thereafter lithographs and paintings from Goethe's Faust .  Paintings such as The Combat of the Giaour and Hassan (1826) ,  and Woman with Parrot (1827) ,  introduced subjects of violence and sensuality which would prove to be recurrent . These various romantic strands came together in The Death of Sardanapalus (1827–28) .  Delacroix's painting of the death of the Assyrian king Sardanapalus shows an emotionally stirring scene alive with beautiful colours ,  exotic costumes and tragic events .  The Death of Sardanapalus depicts the besieged king watching impassively as guards carry out his orders to kill his servants ,  concubines and animals .  The literary source is a play by Byron ,  although the play does not specifically mention any massacre of concubines . Sardanapalus' attitude of calm detachment is a familiar pose in Romantic imagery in this period in Europe .  The painting ,  which was not exhibited again for many years afterward ,  has been regarded by some criticsA variety of Romantic interests were again synthesized in The Murder of the Bishop of Liège (1829) .  It also borrowed from a literary source ,  this time Scott ,  and depicts a scene from the Middle Ages ,  that of the murder of Louis de Bourbon ,  Bishop of Liège amidst an orgy sponsored by his captor ,  William de la Marck .  Set in an immense vaulted interior which Delacroix based on sketches of the Palais de Justice in Rouen and Westminster Hall ,  the drama plays out in chiaroscuro ,  organized around a brilliantly lit stretch of tablecloth .  In 1855 ,  a critic described the painting's vibrant handling as ""Less finished than a painting ,  more finished than a sketch ,  The Murder of the Bishop of Liège was left by the painter at that supreme moment when one more stroke of the brush would have ruined everything"" . Delacroix's most influential work came in 1830 with the painting Liberty Leading the People ,  which for choice of subject and technique highlights the differences between the romantic approach and the neoclassical style .  Less obviously ,  it also differs from the Romanticism of Géricault ,  as exemplified by The Raft of the Medusa . Delacroix felt his composition more vividly as a whole ,  thought of his figures and crowds as types ,  and dominated them by the symbolic figure of Republican Liberty which is one of his finest plastic inventions .  .  . Probably Delacroix's best-known painting ,  Liberty Leading the People is an unforgettable image of Parisians ,  having taken up arms ,  marching forward under the banner of the tricolour representing liberty ,  equality ,  and fraternity .  Although Delacroix was inspired by contemporary events to invoke this romantic image of the spirit of liberty ,  he seems to be trying to convey the will and character of the people , Although the French government bought the painting ,  by 1832 officials deemed its glorification of liberty too inflammatory and removed it from public view . Following the Revolution of 1848 that saw the end of the reign of King Louis Philippe ,  Delacroix' painting ,  Liberty Leading the People ,  was finally put on display by the newly elected President ,  Louis Napoleon (Napoleon III) .  It is exhibited in the Louvre museum in Paris ;  although from December 2012 until 2014 it was on exhibit at Louvre-Lens in Lens ,  Pas-de-Calais . The boy holding a pistol aloft on the right is sometimes thought to be an inspiration for the Gavroche character in Victor Hugo's 1862 novel ,  Les Misérables .   "

847,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Lorenzo_Ghiberti,Lorenzo_Ghiberti,Artist_authors," Ghiberti was born in 1378 in Pelago ,  a comune 20km from Florence . Lorenzo was interested in many forms of art and did not confine himself to gold-working .  He delighted in modeling copies of antique medals and also in painting .  When the bubonic plague struck Florence in 1400 ,  Ghiberti moved to Rimini .  In Rimini he was fortunate enough to receive employment in the palace of Carlo Malatesta for the Lord of Pesaro ,  where he assisted in the completion of wall frescoes of the castle of Carlo I Malatesta . Ghiberti's career was dominated by his two successive commissions for pairs of bronze doors to the Florence Baptistery (Battistero di San Giovanni) .  They are recognized as a major masterpiece of the Early Renaissance ,  and were famous and influential from their unveiling .   Ghiberti first became famous when as a 21-year-old he won the 1401 competition for the first set of bronze doors ,  with Brunelleschi as the runner up .  The original plan was for the doors to depict scenes from the Old Testament ,  but the plan was changed to depict scenes from the New Testament instead .  However ,  the trial piece ,  which survives ,  depicts the sacrifice of Isaac . To carry out this commission ,  he set up a large workshop in which many artists trained ,  including Donatello ,  Masolino ,  Michelozzo ,  Paolo Uccello ,  and Antonio Pollaiuolo .  When his first set of twenty-eight panels was complete ,  Ghiberti was commissioned to produce a second set for another doorway in the church ,  this time with scenes from the Old Testament ,  as originally intended for his first set .  Instead of twenty-eight scenes ,  he produced ten rectangular scenes in a completely different style .  These were more naturalistic ,  with perspective and a greater idealization of the subject .  Dubbed ""The Gates of Paradise"" by Michelangelo ,  this second set remains a major monument of the age of Renaissance humanism . The Gates of Paradise had ten panels with several episodes from a particular story from the Old Testament portrayed on each of them .  The list below shows where each story is placed on the Gates of Paradise .     "

His father ,  a pharmacist ,  viewed art as a ""breadless profession"" and strongly encouraged him to enter pharmacy .  He moved to Zürich in 1962 ,  where he studied architecture and industrial design at the School of Applied Arts until 1970 .   Giger's first success was when H .  H .  Kunz ,  co-owner of Switzerland's first poster publishing company ,  printed and distributed Giger's first posters ,  beginning in 1969 . Giger's style and thematic execution were influential .  He was part of the special effects team that won an Academy Award for Best Achievement in Visual Effects for their design work on the film Alien .  He is also well known for artwork on several music recording albums including Danzig III :  How The Gods Kill by Danzig ,  Brain Salad Surgery by Emerson ,  Lake & Palmer ,  Attahk by Magma ,  Heartwork by Carcass ,  To Mega Therion by Celtic Frost ,  Eparistera Daimones and Melana Chasmata by Triptykon ,  Deborah Harry's KooKoo ,  and Frankenchrist ,  by the Dead Kennedys . In 1998 ,  Giger acquired the Saint-Germain Castle in Gruyères ,  Switzerland ,  which now houses the H . R .  Giger Museum ,  a permanent repository of his work .   "

855,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Nicholas_Hilliard,Nicholas_Hilliard,Artist_authors,"   Hilliard emerged from his apprenticeship at a time when a new royal portrait painter was ""desperately needed"" . Despite this patronage ,  in 1576 the recently married Hilliard left for France ""with no other intent than to increase his knowledge by this voyage ,  and upon hope to get a piece of money of the lords and ladies here for his better maintenance in England at his return"" ,  carefully reported the English Ambassador in Paris ,  Sir Amyas Paulet ,  with whom Hilliard stayed for much of the time .  Francis Bacon was attached to the embassy ,  and Hilliard did a miniature of him in Paris . He appears in the papers of the duc d'Alençon ,  a suitor of Queen Elizabeth ,  under the name of ""Nicholas Belliart ,  peintre anglois"" ,  in 1577 ,  receiving a stipend of 200 livres .  The miniature of Madame de Sourdis ,  certainly the work of Hilliard ,  is dated 1577 ,  in which year she was a maid of honour at the French court ;  and other portraits which are his work are believed to represent Gabrielle d'Estrées (niece of Madame de Sourdis) ,  la princesse de Condé ,  and Madame de Montgomery . Money was a persistent problem for Hilliard .   The typical price for a miniature seems to have been £3 – which compares well with prices charged by Cornelis Ketel in the 1570s of £1 for a head-and-shoulders portrait and £5 for a full-length .  a large amount ,  after he made a second Great Seal ,  and perhaps bearing in mind that he had not had an annuity . After his return from France he had invested in a scheme ,  or perhaps scam ,  for gold-mining in Scotland ,  which he still remembered bitterly twenty-five years later . 21st century research at Waddesdon Manor has transformed our understanding of his work as two large-scale paintings have been newly attributed to him .  The portraits ,  of Sir Amyas Paulet and Elizabeth ,  are painted on French oak panels ,  not the Baltic oak commonly used in England ,  and are thought to date to Hilliard's time in France .  The new data supports Sir Roy Strong's 1983 attribution of the portrait of Elizabeth to Hilliard . After his return from France he lived and worked in a house in Gutter Lane ,  off Cheapside ,  from 1579 to 1613 ,  when his son and pupil Laurence took it over ,  carrying on in business for many decades .  Hilliard had moved to an unknown address in the parish of St Martins-in-the-Fields ,  out of the city and nearer the Court .   Strong describes the opening of the shop as ""a revolution"" which soon broadened the clientele for miniatures from the Court to the gentry ,  and by the end of the century to well-off city merchants . Apart from Laurence ,  who continued in a ""feeble"" version of his father's style ,  his pupils included Isaac Oliver ,  by far the most important ,  and Rowland Lockey .   He appears to have given lessons to amateurs also ;  a letter from a young lady being ""finished"" in London in 1595 says :  ""For my drawing ,  I take an hour in the afternoon .  .  .  My Lady .  .  telleth me ,  He continued to work as a goldsmith ,  and produced some spectacular ""picture boxes"" or jewelled lockets for miniatures ,  worn round the neck ,  such as the Lyte Jewel in the British Museum ,  which ,  typically ,  was given by James I (more generous in this respect than Elizabeth) to a courtier ,  Thomas Lyte ,  in 1610 .  The Armada Jewel ,  given by Elizabeth to Sir Thomas Heneage and the Drake Pendant given to Sir Francis Drake are the best known examples .   As part of the cult of the Virgin Queen ,  courtiers were rather expected to wear the Queen's likeness ,  at least at Court .  Elizabeth had her own collection of miniatures ,  kept locked in a cabinet in her bedroom ,  wrapped in paper and labelled ,  with the one labelled ""My Lord's picture"" containing a portrait of Leicester . His appointment as miniaturist to the Crown included the old sense of a painter of illuminated manuscripts and he was commissioned to decorate important documents ,  such as the founding charter of Emmanuel College ,  Cambridge (1584) ,  which has an enthroned Elizabeth within an elaborate framework of Flemish-style Renaissance ornament .   He also seems to have designed woodcut title-page frames and borders for books ,  some of which bear his initials . He was in high favour with James I as well as with Elizabeth ,  receiving from the king a special patent of appointment ,  dated 5 May 1617 ,  granting him a sole licence for royal portraits in engraved form for twelve years ;  he had already been producing these ,  although probably usually using the immigrant Renold Elstrack to actually engrave the plates . The esteem of his contemporaries for Hilliard is testified to by John Donne ,  who in a poem called The Storm (1597) praises the work of this artist .   He died on about 3 January 1619 and was buried on 7 January 1619 in the church of St Martins-in-the-Fields ,  Westminster ,  leaving in his will twenty shillings to the poor of the parish ,  thirty between his two sisters ,  some goods to his maidservant ,  and all the rest of his effects to his son ,  Lawrence Hilliard ,  his sole executor . By far the largest collection of his work is in the Victoria and Albert Museum ,  London .  The National Portrait Gallery and British Museum in London have several others .  The conditions in which miniatures have been kept ensure that many remain in excellent condition ,  and have avoided the attention of restorers ,  although fading of pigments ,  and oxidization of silver paint are common .

857,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/William_Hogarth,William_Hogarth,Artist_authors," William Hogarth was born at Bartholomew Close in London to Richard Hogarth ,  a poor Latin school teacher and textbook writer ,  and Anne Gibbons .  In his youth he was apprenticed to the engraver Ellis Gamble in Leicester Fields ,  where he learned to engrave trade cards and similar products . Young Hogarth also took a lively interest in the street life of the metropolis and the London fairs ,  and amused himself by sketching the characters he saw .   Around the same time ,  his father ,  who had opened an unsuccessful Latin-speaking coffee house at St John's Gate ,  was imprisoned for debt in the Fleet Prison for five years .  Hogarth never spoke of his father's imprisonment . In 1720 ,  Hogarth enrolled at the original St Martin's Lane Academy in Peter Court ,  London ,  which was run by Louis Chéron and John Vanderbank .  He attended alongside other future leading figures in art and design ,  such as Joseph Highmore ,  William Kent ,  and Arthur Pond . Hogarth became a member of the Rose and Crown Club ,  with Peter Tillemans ,  George Vertue ,  Michael Dahl ,  and other artists and connoisseurs .   By April 1720 ,  Hogarth was an engraver in his own right ;  at first engraving coats of arms ,  shop bills ,  and designing plates for booksellers . In 1727 ,  he was hired by Joshua Morris ,  a tapestry worker ,  to prepare a design for the Element of Earth .  Morris heard that he was ""an engraver ,  and no painter"" ,  and consequently declined the work when completed .  Hogarth accordingly sued him for the money in the Westminster Court ,  where the case was decided in his favour on 28 May 1728 . Early satirical works included an Emblematical Print on the South Sea Scheme (c . 1721 ,  published 1724) ,  about the disastrous stock market crash of 1720 ,  known as the South Sea Bubble ,  in which many English people lost a great deal of money .  In the bottom left corner ,  he shows Protestant ,  Roman Catholic ,  and Jewish figures gambling ,  while in the middle there is a huge machine ,  like a merry-go-round ,  which people are boarding .  At the top is a goat ,  written below which is ""Who'l Ride"" .  The people are scattered around the picture with a sense of disorder ,  while the progress of the well dressed people towards the ride in the middle shows the foolishness of the crowd in buying stock in the South Sea Company ,  which spent more time issuing stock than anything else . Other early works include The Lottery (1724) ;  The Mystery of Masonry brought to Light by the Gormagons (1724) ;   A Just View of the British Stage (1724) ;  some book illustrations ;  and the small print Masquerades and Operas (1724) .  The latter is a satire on contemporary follies ,  such as the masquerades of the Swiss impresario John James Heidegger ,  the popular Italian opera singers ,  John Rich's pantomimes at Lincoln's Inn Fields ,  and the exaggerated popularity of Lord Burlington's protégé ,  the architect and painter William Kent .  He continued that theme in 1727 ,  with the Large Masquerade Ticket .  In 1726 ,  Hogarth prepared twelve large engravings illustrating Samuel Butler's Hudibras .  These he himself valued highly ,  and they are among his best book illustrations . In the following years ,  he turned his attention to the production of small ""conversation pieces"" (i . e .  ,  groups in oil of full-length portraits from 12 to 15 inches (300 to 380mm) high .  Among his efforts in oil between 1728 and 1732 were The Fountaine Family (c . 1730) ,  The Assembly at Wanstead House ,  The House of Commons examining Bambridge ,  and several pictures of the chief actors in John Gay's popular The Beggar's Opera . One of Hogarth's masterpieces of this period is the depiction of an amateur performance by children of John Dryden's The Indian Emperour ,  or The Conquest of Mexico by Spaniards ,  being the Sequel of The Indian Queen (1732–1735) at the home of John Conduitt ,  master of the mint ,  in St George's Street ,  Hanover Square . Hogarth's other works in the 1730s include A Midnight Modern Conversation (1733) ,  Southwark Fair (1733) ,  The Sleeping Congregation (1736) ,  Before and After (1736) ,  Scholars at a Lecture (1736) ,  The Company of Undertakers (Consultation of Quacks) (1736) ,  The Distrest Poet (1736) ,  The Four Times of the Day (1738) ,  and Strolling Actresses Dressing in a Barn (1738) .  He might also have printed Burlington Gate (1731) ,  evoked by Alexander Pope's Epistle to Lord Burlington ,  and defending Lord Chandos ,  who is therein satirized .  This print gave great offence ,  and was suppressed .  However ,  modern authorities such as Ronald Paulson no longer attribute it to Hogarth . In 1731 ,  Hogarth completed the earliest of his series of moral works ,  a body of work that led to significant recognition .  The collection of six scenes was entitled A Harlot's Progress and appeared first as paintings (now lost)The inaugural series was an immediate success and was followed in 1733–1735 by the sequel A Rake's Progress . When the success of A Harlot's Progress and A Rake's Progress resulted in numerous pirated reproductions by unscrupulous printsellers ,  Hogarth lobbied in parliament for greater legal control over the reproduction of his and other artists' work .  The result was the Engravers' Copyright Act (known as 'Hogarth's Act') ,  which became law on 25 June 1735 and was the first copyright law to deal with visual works as well as the first to recognise the authorial rights of an individual artist . In 1743–1745 ,  Hogarth painted the six pictures of Marriage A-la-Mode (National Gallery ,  London) ,  a pointed skewering of upper-class 18th-century society .  This moralistic warning shows the miserable tragedy of an ill-considered marriage for money .  This is regarded by many as his finest project and may be among his best-planned story serials . Marital ethics were the topic of much debate in 18th-century Britain .  The many marriages of convenience and their attendant unhappiness came in for particular criticism ,  with a variety of authors taking the view that love was a much sounder basis for marriage .  Hogarth here painted a satire – a genre that by definition has a moral point to convey – of a conventional marriage within the English upper class .  All the paintings were engraved and the series achieved wide circulation in print form .  The series ,  which is set in a Classical interior ,  shows the story of the fashionable marriage of Viscount Squanderfield ,  the son of bankrupt Earl Squander ,  to the daughter of a wealthy but miserly city merchant ,  starting with the signing of a marriage contract at the Earl's grand house and ending with the murder of the son by his wife's lover and the suicide of the daughter after her lover is hanged at Tyburn for murdering her husband . William Makepeace Thackeray wrote :  This famous set of pictures contains the most important and highly wrought of the Hogarth comedies .  The care and method with which the moral grounds of these pictures are laid is as remarkable as the wit and skill of the observing and dexterous artist .  He has to describe the negotiations for a marriage pending between the daughter of a rich citizen Alderman and young Lord Viscount Squanderfield ,  the dissipated son of a gouty old Earl  .  .  .  The dismal end is known .  My lord draws upon the counsellor ,  who kills him ,  and is apprehended while endeavouring to escape .  My lady goes back perforce to the Alderman of the City ,  and faints upon reading Counsellor Silvertongue's dying speech at Tyburn (place of execution in old London) ,  where the counsellor has been 'executed for sending his lordship out of the world .  Moral :  don't listen to evil silver-tongued counsellors ;  don't marry a man for his rank ,  or a woman for her money ;  don't frequent foolish auctions and masquerade balls unknown to your husband ;  don't have wicked companions abroad and neglect your wife ,  otherwise you will be run through the body ,  and ruin will ensue ,  and disgrace ,  and Tyburn . In the twelve prints of Industry and Idleness (1747) ,  Hogarth shows the progression in the lives of two apprentices ,  one of whom is dedicated and hard working ,  while the other ,  who is idle ,  commits crime and is eventually executed .  This shows the work ethic of Protestant England ,  where those who worked hard were rewarded ,  such as the industrious apprentice who becomes Sheriff (plate 8) ,  Alderman (plate 10) ,  and finally the Lord Mayor of London in the last plate in the series .  The idle apprentice ,  who begins ""at play in the church yard"" (plate 3) ,  holes up ""in a Garrett with a Common Prostitute"" after turning highwayman (plate 7) and ""executed at Tyburn"" (plate 11) .  The idle apprentice is sent to the gallows by the industrious apprentice himself .  For each plate ,  there is at least one passage from the Bible at the bottom ,  mostly from the Book of Proverbs ,  such as for the first plate : Later prints of significance include his pictorial warning of the consequences of alcoholism in Beer Street and Gin Lane (1751) . In Beer Street ,  people are shown as healthy ,  happy and prosperous ,  while in Gin Lane ,  they are scrawny ,  lazy and careless .  The woman at the front of Gin Lane ,  who lets her baby fall to its death ,  echoes the tale of Judith Dufour ,  who strangled her baby so she could sell its clothes for gin money .  The prints were published in support of the Gin Act 1751 . Hogarth's friend ,  the magistrate Henry Fielding ,  may have enlisted Hogarth to help with propaganda for the Gin Act ;  Beer Street and Gin Lane were issued shortly after his work An Enquiry into the Causes of the Late Increase of Robbers ,  and Related Writings ,  and addressed the same issues . Other prints were his outcry against inhumanity in The Four Stages of Cruelty (published 21 February 1751) ,  in which Hogarth depicts the cruel treatment of animals which he saw around him and suggests what will happen to people who carry on in this manner .  In the first print ,  there are scenes of boys torturing dogs ,  cats and other animals .  It centers around a poorly dressed boy committing a  violent act of torture upon a dog ,  while being pleaded with to stop ,  and offered food ,  by another well-dressed boy .  A boy behind them has graffitied a hanged stickman figure upon a wall ,  with the name ""Tom Nero"" underneath ,  and is pointing to this dog torturer . The second shows Tom Nero has grown up to become a Hackney coach driver .  His coach has overturned with a heavy load and his horse is lying on the ground ,  having broken its leg .  He is beating it with the handle of his whip ;  its eye severely wounded .  Other people around him are seen abusing their work animals and livestock ,  and a child is being run over by the wheel of a dray ,  as the drayman dozes off on the job . In the third print ,  Tom is shown to be a murderer ,  surrounded by a mob of accusers .  The woman he has apparently killed is lying on the ground ,  brutally slain ,  with a trunk and sack of stolen goods near by .  One of the accusers holds a letter from the woman to Tom ,  speaking of how wronging her mistress upsets her conscience ,  but that she is resolved to do as he would have her ,  closing with :  ""I remain yours till death . ""The fourth ,  titled The Reward of Cruelty ,  shows Tom's withering corpse being publicly dissected by scientists after his execution by hanging ;  a noose still around his neck .  The dissection reflects the Murder Act 1751 ,  which allowed for the public dissection of criminals who had been hanged for murder . Hogarth was also popular portrait painter .  In 1745 ,  he painted actor David Garrick as Richard III , In 1740 ,  may be called masterpieces of British painting .  There are also portraits of his wife ,  his two sisters ,  and of many other people ;  among them Bishop Hoadly and Bishop Herring . For a long period ,  during the mid-18th century ,  Hogarth tried to achieve the status of a history painter ,  but did not earn much respect in this field .  The painter ,  and later founder of the Royal Academy of Arts ,  Joshua Reynolds ,  was highly critical of Hogarth's style and work .  According to art history professor ,  David Bindman ,  in Dr Johnson's serial of essays for London's Universal Chronicle ,  The Idler ,  the three essays written by Reynolds for the months of September through November 1759 are directed at Hogarth .  In them ,  Reynolds argues that this ""connoisseur"" has a ""servile attention to minute exactness"" and questions their idea of the imitation of nature as ""the obvious sense ,  that objects are represented naturally when they have such relief that they seem real . "" Reynolds rejected ""this kind of imitation"" ,  favouring the ""grand style of painting"" which avoids ""minute attention"" to the visible world . Writer ,  art historian and politician ,  Horace Walpole ,  was also critical of Hogarth as a history painter ,  but did find value in his satirical prints . Hogarth's history pictures include The Pool of Bethesda and The Good Samaritan ,  executed in 1736–1737 for St Bartholomew's Hospital ; The Gate of Calais (1748 ;  now in Tate Britain) was produced soon after his return from a visit to France .  Horace Walpole wrote that Hogarth had run a great risk to go there since the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle :  he went to France ,  and was so imprudent as to be taking a sketch of the drawbridge at Calais .  He was seized and carried to the governor ,  where he was forced to prove his vocation by producing several caricatures of the French ;  particularly a scene of the shore ,  with an immense piece of beef landing for the Lion d'argent ,  the English inn at Calais ,  and several hungry friars following it .  They were much diverted with his drawings ,  and dismissed him . Back home ,  he immediately executed a painting of the subject in which he unkindly represented his enemies ,  the Frenchmen ,  as cringing ,  emaciated and superstitious people ,  while an enormous sirloin of beef arrives ,  destined for the English inn as a symbol of British prosperity and superiority .  He claimed to have painted himself into the picture in the left corner sketching the gate ,  with a ""soldier's hand upon my shoulder"" ,  running him in . Notable Hogarth engravings in the 1740s include The Enraged Musician (1741) ,  the six prints of Marriage à-la-mode (1745 ;  executed by French artists under Hogarth's inspection) ,  and The Stage Coach or The Country Inn Yard (1747) . In 1745 ,  Hogarth painted a self-portrait with his pug dog ,  Trump (now also in Tate Britain) ,  which shows him as a learned artist supported by volumes of Shakespeare ,  Milton and Swift . Others works included his ingenious Satire on False Perspective (1754) ; In 1757 ,  Hogarth was appointed Serjeant Painter to the King . Hogarth wrote and published his ideas of artistic design in his book The Analysis of Beauty (1753) . Hogarth lived in an age when artwork became increasingly commercialized ,  being viewed in shop windows ,  taverns ,  and public buildings ,  and sold in printshops .  Old hierarchies broke down ,  and new forms began to flourish :  the ballad opera ,  the bourgeois tragedy ,  and especially ,  a new form of fiction called the novel with which authors such as Henry Fielding had great success .  Therefore ,  by that time ,  Hogarth hit on a new idea :  ""painting and engraving modern moral subjects  .  .  .  to treat my subjects as a dramatic writer ;  my picture was my stage"" ,  as he himself remarked in his manuscript notes . He drew from the highly moralizing Protestant tradition of Dutch genre painting ,  and the very vigorous satirical traditions of the English broadsheet and other types of popular print .  In England the fine arts had little comedy in them before Hogarth .  His prints were expensive ,  and remained so until early 19th-century reprints brought them to a wider audience . When analysing the work of the artist as a whole ,  Ronald Paulson says ,  ""In A Harlot's Progress ,  every single plate but one is based on Dürer's images of the story of the Virgin and the story of the Passion . "" In other works ,  he parodies Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper .  According to Paulson ,  Hogarth is subverting the religious establishment and the orthodox belief in an immanent God who intervenes in the lives of people and produces miracles .  Indeed ,  Hogarth was a Deist ,  a believer in a God who created the universe but takes no direct hand in the lives of his creations .  Thus ,  as a ""comic history painter"" ,  he often poked fun at the old-fashioned ,  ""beaten"" subjects of religious art in his paintings and prints .  Hogarth also rejected Lord Shaftesbury's then-current ideal of the classical Greek male in favour of the living ,  breathing female .  He said ,  ""Who but a bigot ,  even to the antiques ,  will say that he has not seen faces and necks ,  hands and arms in living women ,  that even the Grecian Venus doth but coarsely imitate . "" On 25 October 1764 ,  Hogarth was conveyed from his villa in Chiswick to his home in Leicester Fields ,  in weak condition .  He had been in a weakened state for a while by this time ,  but was said to be in a cheerful mood and was even still working—with some help ;  doing more retouches on The Bench on this same day . Mrs Lewis ,  who stayed on with Jane Hogarth in Leicester Fields , Hogarth was buried at St .  Nicholas Church ,  Chiswick ,  now in the west of London . Farewell great Painter of MankindWho reach'd the noblest point of ArtWhose pictur'd Morals charm the MindAnd through the Eye correct the Heart . If Genius fire thee ,  Reader ,  stay , If Nature touch thee ,  drop a Tear : If neither move thee ,  turn away , For Hogarth's honour'd dust lies here .  "

863,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Kalidasa,Kalidasa,Artist_authors," Scholars have speculated that Kālidāsa may have lived near the Himalayas ,  in the vicinity of Ujjain ,  and in Kalinga .  This hypothesis is based on Kālidāsa's detailed description of the Himalayas in his Kumārasambhava ,  the display of his love for Ujjain in Meghadūta ,  and his highly eulogistic descriptions of Kalingan emperor Hemāngada in Raghuvaṃśa (sixth sarga) . Lakshmi Dhar Kalla (1891–1953) ,  a Sanskrit scholar and a Kashmiri Pandit ,  wrote a book titled The birth-place of Kalidasa (1926) ,  which tries to trace the birthplace of Kālidāsa based on his writings .  He concluded that Kālidāsa was born in Kashmir ,  but moved southwards ,  and sought the patronage of local rulers to prosper .  The evidence cited by him from Kālidāsa's writings includes : Still otherAccording to folklore ,  a scholarly princess once decides to find a suitable groom by testing men in her kingdom for their intelligence .  When no man is able to pass the test ,  the frustrated citizens decide to send Kālidāsa ,  an uneducated man ,  for an interview with the princess . In another version ,  the court's chief minister is insulted when the princess rejects his son's marriage proposal .  To avenge this insult ,  the minister finds the most unfit person ,  the shepherd Kālidāsa ,  to send to the princess . In any case Kālidasa fares poorly ,  and is greatly humiliated by the princess .  Thus challenged ,  he visits a Kāli temple ,  is inspired to learn Sanskrit ,  studies the Purāṇas and other ancient texts ,  and becomes a great poet . He then writes three epics starting with the words of his insult :  ""अस्ति कश्चित् वाग्विशेष?""(asti kaścit vagviśeṣa? is there anything particularly intelligent you can now say? ,  implying ,  have you attained any profound knowledge that should make me give you a special welcome?)From these three words he embraces ,  he writes his three classic books .  From “asti” = asti-uttarasyaam diśi ,  he produces the epic “Kumārasambhava” ;  from “Kaścit”  = kaścit-kāntā ,  he writes the poem “Meghadūta” and from “Vāgviśeṣa”= vāgarthāviva ,  he wrote the epic “Raghuvaṃśa"" . Another old legend recounts that Kālidāsa visits Kumāradāsa ,  the king of Lanka and ,  because of treachery ,  is murdered there .     "

880,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/William_Morris,William_Morris,Artist_authors," Morris was born at Elm House in Walthamstow ,  Essex ,  on 24 March 1834 . As a child ,  Morris was kept largely housebound at Elm House by his mother ;  there ,  he spent much time reading ,  favouring the novels of Walter Scott . In 1847 ,  Morris's father died unexpectedly .  From this point ,  the family relied upon continued income from the copper mines at Devon Great Consols ,  and sold Woodford Hall to move into the smaller Water House . In June 1852 Morris entered Exeter College at Oxford University ,  although ,  since the college was full ,  he only went into residence in January 1853 . At the college ,  Morris met fellow first-year undergraduate Edward Burne-Jones ,  who became his lifelong friend and collaborator .  Although from very different backgrounds ,  they found that they had a shared attitude to life ,  both being keenly interested in Anglo-Catholicism and Arthurianism . Morris was heavily influenced by the writings of the art critic John Ruskin ,  being particularly inspired by his chapter ""On the Nature of Gothic Architecture"" in the second volume of The Stones of Venice ;  he later described it as ""one of the very few necessary and inevitable utterances of the century"" . Both he and Burne-Jones were influenced by the Romanticist milieu and the Anglo-Catholic movement ,  and decided to become clergymen in order to found a monastery where they could live a life of chastity and dedication to artistic pursuit ,  akin to that of the contemporary Nazarene movement .  However ,  as time went on Morris became increasingly critical of Anglican doctrine and the idea faded . Having passed his finals and been awarded a BA ,  Morris began an apprenticeship with the Oxford-based Neo-Gothic architect George Edmund Street in January 1856 .  His apprenticeship focused on architectural drawing ,  and there he was placed under the supervision of the young architect Philip Webb ,  who became a close friend . Morris became increasingly fascinated with the idyllic Medievalist depictions of rural life which appeared in the paintings of the Pre-Raphaelites ,  and spent large sums of money purchasing such artworks .  Burne-Jones shared this interest ,  but took it further by becoming an apprentice to one of the foremost Pre-Raphaelite painters ,  Dante Gabriel Rossetti ;  the three soon became close friends . Morris also continued writing poetry and began designing illuminated manuscripts and embroidered hangings .     "

As a boy ,  he came under the influence of Zachariah Mudge ,  whose Platonistic philosophy stayed with him all his life .

Having shown an early interest in art ,  Reynolds was apprenticed in 1740 to the fashionable London portrait painter Thomas Hudson ,  who had been born in Devon . In 1749 ,  Reynolds met Commodore Augustus Keppel ,  who invited him to join HMS Centurion ,  of which he had command ,  on a voyage to the Mediterranean .  While with the ship he visited Lisbon ,  Cadiz ,  Algiers ,  and Minorca .  From Minorca he travelled to Livorno in Italy ,  and then to Rome ,  While in Rome he suffered a severe cold ,  which left him partially deaf ,  and ,  as a result ,  he began to carry a small ear trumpet with which he is often pictured . Reynolds travelled homeward overland via Florence ,  Bologna ,  Venice , Alongside ambitious full-length portraits ,  Reynolds painted large numbers of smaller works .  In the late 1750s ,  at the height of the social season ,  he received five or six sitters a day ,  each for an hour . The clothing of Reynolds' sitters was usually painted by either one of his pupils , Reynolds often adapted the poses of his subjects from the works of earlier artists ,  a practice mocked by Nathaniel Hone in a painting called The Conjuror submitted to the Royal Academy exhibition of 1775 ,  and now in the collection of the National Gallery of Ireland .  It shows a figure representing ,  though not resembling ,  Reynolds ,  seated in front of a cascade of prints from which Reynolds had borrowed with varying degrees of subtlety . Although not known principally for his landscapes ,  Reynolds did paint in this genre .  He had an excellent vantage from his house ,  Wick House ,  on Richmond Hill ,  and painted the view in about 1780 . Reynolds also was recognized for his portraits of children .  He emphasized the innocence and natural grace of children when depicting them .  His 1788 portrait ,  Age of Innocence ,  is his best known character study of a child .  The subject of the painting is not known ,  although conjecture includes Theophila Gwatkin ,  his great niece ,  and Lady Anne Spencer ,  the youngest daughter of the fourth Duke of Marlborough . Reynolds worked long hours in his studio ,  rarely taking a holiday .  He was gregarious and keenly intellectual ,  with many friends from London's intelligentsia ,  numbered amongst whom were Dr Samuel Johnson ,  Oliver Goldsmith ,  Edmund Burke ,  Giuseppe Baretti ,  Henry Thrale ,  David Garrick ,  and artist Angelica Kauffman .  Johnson said in 1778 :  ""Reynolds is too much under Because of his popularity as a portrait painter ,  Reynolds enjoyed constant interaction with the wealthy and famous men and women of the day ,  and it was he who brought together the figures of ""The Club"" .  It was founded in 1764 and met in a suite of rooms on the first floor of the Turks Head at 9 Gerrard Street ,  now marked by a plaque .  Original members included Burke ,  Bennet Langton ,  Topham Beauclerk ,  Goldsmith ,  Anthony Chamier ,  Thomas Hawkins ,  and Nugent ,  to be joined by Garrick ,  Boswell ,  and Sheridan .  In ten years the membership had risen to 35 .  The Club met every Monday evening for supper and conversation and continued into the early hours of Tuesday morning .  In later years ,  it met fortnightly during Parliamentary sessions .  When in 1783 the landlord of the Turks Head died and the property was sold ,  The Club moved to Sackville Street . Reynolds was one of the earliest members of the Royal Society of Arts ,  helped found the Society of Artists of Great Britain ,  and in 1768 became the first president of the Royal Academy of Arts ,  a position he was to hold until his death .  In 1769 ,  he was knighted by George III ,  only the second artist to be so honoured . Reynolds and the Royal Academy received a mixed reception .  Critics included William Blake who published the vitriolic Annotations to Sir Joshua Reynolds' Discourses in 1808 .  J .  M .  W .  Turner and James Northcote were fervent acolytes :  Turner requested he be laid to rest at Reynolds' side ,  and Northcote ,  who spent four years as Reynolds' pupil ,  wrote to his family ""I know him thoroughly ,  and all his faults ,  I am sure ,  and yet almost worship him . ""The Royal Academy of Art in London celebrated its 250th anniversary in 2018 ,  since its opening in 1768 .  This became an impetus for galleries and museums across the UK to celebrate ""the making ,  debating and exhibiting art at the Royal Academy"" .  Waddesdon manor was amongst the historic houses that supported Sir Joshua Reynolds's influence at the academy ,  acknowledging how : In the Battle of Ushant against the French in 1778 ,  Lord Keppel commanded the Channel Fleet and the outcome resulted in no clear winner ;  Keppel ordered the attack be renewed and was obeyed except by Sir Hugh Palliser ,  who commanded the rear ,  and the French escaped bombardment .  A dispute between Keppel and Palliser arose and Palliser brought charges of misconduct and neglect of duty against Keppel and the Admiralty decided to court-martial him .  On 11 February 1779 Keppel was acquitted of all charges and became a national hero .  One of Keppel's lawyers commissioned Sir Nathaniel Dance-Holland to paint a portrait of Keppel but Keppel redirected it to Reynolds .  Reynolds alluded to Keppel's trial in the painting by painting his hand on his sword ,  reflecting the presiding officer's words at the court-martial :  ""In delivering to you your sword ,  I am to congratulate you on its being restored to you with so much honour"" . On 10 August 1784 Allan Ramsay died and the office of Principal Painter in Ordinary to King George III became vacant .  Gainsborough felt that he had a good chance of securing it ,  but Reynolds felt he deserved it and threatened to resign the presidency of the Royal Academy if he did not receive it .  Reynolds noted in his pocket book :  ""Sept .  1 ,  2½ ,  to attend at the Lord Chancellor's Office to be sworn in painter to the King"" . In 1787 Reynolds painted the portrait of Lord Heathfield ,  who became a national hero for the successful defence of Gibraltar in the Great Siege from 1779 to 1783 against the combined forces of France and Spain .  Heathfield is depicted against a background of clouds and cannon smoke ,  wearing the uniform of the 15th Light Dragoons and clasping the key of the Rock ,  its chain wrapped twice around his right hand .

901,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/David_Robilliard,David_Robilliard,Artist_authors,"   David Robilliard met Gilbert & George around 1979 ,  and became one of their models ;  he was charged with finding models for them in Soho ,  as well as the east and west ends . David Robilliard pursued his career in poetry during his early years in London .  His work was supported by Gilbert & George who also encouraged Robilliard to associate images to his written work .  They published his first poetry volume ,  Inevitable ,  in 1984 .  His first exhibition of drawings in the same year ,  at the Stephen Bartley Gallery ,  was originally only meant as a backdrop to the book's launch .  Stephen Bartley describes the way the exhibition developed :  ""the exhibition was conceived at short notice in collaboration with Andrew Heard ,  most of the drawings (other than those used in the books) were done in the two weeks before the show .  I suggested that David and Andrew hire a few frames so that the drawings could be hung as a backdrop to the party .  I was amazed when they produced some 40 pieces and mounted a professional show .  Everything was priced at £75 ,  no catalogue was produced because we were concentrating on the book .  One sale to Anthony d'Offay resulted .  ( .  .  . ) The exhibition was taken down the day after as the frames had to be returned . ""His drawings were also exhibited at l'Escargot ,  where the first public reading of his poetry took place ,  performed by Stephen Chamberlain .  David Robilliard did not want to perform his own poetry live ;  instead ,  he recruited people to perform his poetry for him .  This included artists such as Leo Burley ,  who relates his experience in ""Memory of a Friend"" . From 1984 onwards ,  almost all of the 58 paintings he produced between 1987 and 1988 were portraits .  They are portraits of anonymous people he observed as well as acquaintances and fellow artists such as Andrew Heard ,  Gilbert & George and Duggie Fields . His second volume of poetry ,  Swallowing Helmets ,  was published in 1987 .  Through 1987 ,  Robilliard distributed shorter poems on postcards that were then sent through the post to a small mailing list .  The poems were printed on an old letterpress by the art dealer Paul Conran .  They distributed a poem card through the post each month in 1987 .  In December 1987 ,  the twelve poems cards were reprinted by Birch & Conran as A Box of Poems in an edition of 100 copies ;  the first 30 copies contained a live cassette recording of Robilliard reading each poem .  Birch & Conran also posthumously published poem cards for August to December 1988 .  His poem cards were also produced by Gilbert & George ,  Hercules Fisherman ,  Judy Adam and Lorcan O' Neill . His artwork was exhibited at the L'Escargot ,  a restaurant in Soho ,  and the Hippodrome ,  a music venue on Charing Cross . Currently ,  his artwork is exhibited at Tate Modern in London as well as the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam .  David Robilliard was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1988 .  He took to introducing himself as ""David Robilliaids"" after that point .  He died within the year .  "

904,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Dante_Gabriel_Rossetti,Dante_Gabriel_Rossetti,Artist_authors," The son of émigré Italian scholar Gabriele Pasquale Giuseppe Rossetti and his wife Frances Mary Lavinia Polidori ,  Gabriel Charles Dante Rossetti was born in London ,  on 12 May 1828 .  His family and friends called him Gabriel ,  but in publications he put the name Dante first in honour of Dante Alighieri .  He was the brother of poet Christina Rossetti ,  critic William Michael Rossetti ,  and author Maria Francesca Rossetti . The youthful Rossetti is described as ""self-possessed ,  articulate ,  passionate and charismatic""Following the exhibition of William Holman Hunt's painting The Eve of St .  Agnes ,  Rossetti sought out Hunt's friendship .  The painting illustrated a poem by John Keats .  Rossetti's own poem ,  ""The Blessed Damozel"" ,  was an imitation of Keats ,  and he believed Hunt might share his artistic and literary ideals .  Together they developed the philosophy of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood which they founded along with John Everett Millais . The group's intention was to reform English art by rejecting what they considered to be the mechanistic approach first adopted by the Mannerist artists who succeeded Raphael and Michelangelo and the formal training regime introduced by Sir Joshua Reynolds .  Their approach was to return to the abundant detail ,  intense colours ,  and complex compositions of Quattrocento Italian and Flemish art .  The eminent critic John Ruskin wrote : Every Pre-Raphaelite landscape background is painted to the last touch ,  in the open air ,  from the thing itself .  Every Pre-Raphaelite figure ,  however studied in expression ,  is a true portrait of some living person . For the first issue of the brotherhood's magazine ,  The Germ ,  published early in 1850 ,  Rossetti contributed a poem ,  ""The Blessed Damozel"" ,  and a story about a fictional early Italian artist inspired by a vision of a woman who bids him combine the human and the divine in his art .  Rossetti was always more interested in the medieval than in the modern side of the movement ,  working on translations of Dante and other medieval Italian poets ,  and adopting the stylistic characteristics of the early Italians .   Rossetti's first major paintings in oil display the realist qualities of the early Pre-Raphaelite movement .  His Girlhood of Mary Virgin (1849) and Ecce Ancilla Domini (1850) portray Mary as a teenage girl .  William Bell Scott saw Girlhood in progress in Hunt's studio and remarked on young Rossetti's technique : He was painting in oils with water-colour brushes ,  as thinly as in water-colour ,  on canvas which he had primed with white till the surface was a smooth as cardboard ,  and every tint remained transparent .   I saw at once that he was not an orthodox boy ,  but acting purely from the aesthetic motive .   The mixture of genius and dilettantism of both men shut me up for the moment ,  and whetted my curiosity . Stung by criticism of his second major painting ,  Ecce Ancilla Domini ,  exhibited in 1850 ,  and the ""increasingly hysterical critical reaction that greeted Pre-Raphaelitism"" that year ,  Rossetti turned to watercolours ,  which could be sold privately .  Although his work subsequently won support from John Ruskin ,  Rossetti only rarely exhibited thereafter . In 1850 ,  Rossetti met Elizabeth Siddal ,  an important model for the Pre-Raphaelite painters .  Over the next decade ,  she became his muse ,  his pupil ,  and his passion .  They were married in 1860 . For many years ,  Rossetti worked on English translations of Italian poetry including Dante Alighieri's La Vita Nuova (published as The Early Italian Poets in 1861) .  These and Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur inspired his art of the 1850s .  He created a method of painting in watercolours ,  using thick pigments mixed with gum to give rich effects similar to medieval illuminations .  He also developed a novel drawing technique in pen-and-ink .  His first published illustration was ""The Maids of Elfen-Mere"" (1855) ,  for a poem by his friend William Allingham ,  and he contributed two illustrations to Edward Moxon's 1857 edition of Alfred ,  Lord Tennyson's Poems and illustrations for works by his sister Christina Rossetti . His visions of Arthurian romance and medieval design also inspired William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones . In February 1857 ,  Rossetti wrote to William Bell Scott : Two young men ,  projectors of the Oxford and Cambridge Magazine ,  have recently come up to town from Oxford ,  and are now very intimate friends of mine .  Their names are Morris and Jones .  They have turned artists instead of taking up any other career to which the university generally leads ,  and both are men of real genius .  Jones's designs are marvels of finish and imaginative detail ,  unequalled by anything unless perhaps Albert Dürer's finest works . That summer Morris and Rossetti visited Oxford and finding the Oxford Union debating-hall under construction ,  pursued a commission to paint the upper walls with scenes from Le Morte d'Arthur and to decorate the roof between the open timbers .  Seven artists were recruited ,  among them Valentine Prinsep and Arthur Hughes , Literature was integrated into the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood's artistic practice from the beginning (including that of Rossetti) ,  with many paintings making direct literary references .  For example ,  John Everett Millais' early work ,  Isabella (1849) ,  depicts an episode from John Keats' Isabella ,  or ,  the Pot of Basil (1818) .  Rossetti was particularly critical of the gaudy ornamentation of Victorian gift books and sought to refine bindings and illustrations to align with the principles of the Aesthetic Movement . Pre-Raphaelite illustrations do not simply refer to the text in which they appear ;  rather ,  they are part of a bigger program of art :  the book as a whole .  Rossetti's philosophy about the role of illustration was revealed in an 1855 letter to poet William Allingham ,  when he wrote ,  in reference to his work on the Moxon Tennyson : ""I have not begun even designing for them yet ,  but fancy I shall try the Vision of Sin ,  and Palace of Art etc . —those where one can allegorize on one’s own hook ,  without killing for oneself and everyone a distinct idea of the poet’s . ""This passage makes apparent Rossetti's desire not to just support the poet's narrative ,  but to create an allegorical illustration that functions separately from the text as well .  In this respect ,  Pre-Raphaelite illustrations go beyond depicting an episode from a poem ,  but rather function like subject paintings within a text .  Illustration is not subservient to text and vice versa .  Careful and conscientious craftsmanship is practiced in every aspect of production ,  and each element ,  though qualifiedly artistic in its own right ,  contributes to a unified art object (the book) . England began to see a revival of religious beliefs and practices starting in 1833 and moving onward to about 1845 . From the beginning of the Brotherhood's formation in 1848 ,  their pieces of art included subjects of noble or religious disposition .  Their aim was to communicate a message of ""moral reform"" through the style of their works ,  exhibiting a ""truth to nature"" .  William Michael Rossetti ,  his brother ,  wrote in 1895 :  ""He was never confirmed ,  professed no religious faith ,  and practised no regular religious observances ;  but he had  .  .  .  sufficient sympathy with the abstract ideas and the venerable forms of Christianity to go occasionally to an Anglican church — very occasionally ,  and only as the inclination ruled him . ""Around 1860 ,  Rossetti returned to oil painting ,  abandoning the dense medieval compositions of the 1850s in favour of powerful close-up images of women in flat pictorial spaces characterised by dense colour .  These paintings became a major influence on the development of the European Symbolist movement . In 1861 ,  Rossetti became a founding partner in the decorative arts firm ,  Morris ,  Marshall ,  Faulkner & Co .  with Morris ,  Burne-Jones ,  Ford Madox Brown ,  Philip Webb ,  Charles Faulkner and Peter Paul Marshall .  Rossetti contributed designs for stained glass and other decorative objects . Rossetti's wife ,  Elizabeth ,  died of an overdose of laudanum in 1862 ,  possibly a suicide ,  shortly after giving birth to a stillborn child . After the death of his wife ,  Rossetti leased a Tudor House at 16 ,  Cheyne Walk ,  in Chelsea ,  where he lived for 20 years surrounded by extravagant furnishings and a parade of exotic birds and animals . Rossetti maintained Fanny Cornforth (described delicately by William Allington as Rossetti's ""housekeeper"")In 1865 ,  he discovered auburn-haired Alexa Wilding ,  a dressmaker and would-be actress who was engaged to model for him on a full-time basis and sat for Veronica Veronese ,  The Blessed Damozel ,  A Sea–Spell ,  and other paintings . Jane Morris ,  whom Rossetti had used as a model for the Oxford Union murals he painted with William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones in 1857 ,  also sat for him during these years ,  she ""consumed and obsessed him in paint ,  poetry ,  and life"" . During these years ,  Rossetti was prevailed upon by friends ,  in particular Charles Augustus Howell ,  to exhume his poems from his wife's grave which he did ,  collating and publishing them in 1870 in the volume Poems by D .  G .  Rossetti .  They created controversy when they were attacked as the epitome of the ""fleshly school of poetry"" .  Their eroticism and sensuality caused offence .  One poem ,  ""Nuptial Sleep"" ,  described a couple falling asleep after sex .  It was part of Rossetti's sonnet sequence The House of Life ,  a complex series of poems tracing the physical and spiritual development of an intimate relationship .  Rossetti described the sonnet form as a ""moment's monument"" ,  implying that it sought to contain the feelings of a fleeting moment ,  and reflect on their meaning .  The House of Life was a series of interacting monuments to these moments – an elaborate whole made from a mosaic of intensely described fragments .  It was Rossetti's most substantial literary achievement .  The collection included some translations ,  including his ""Ballad Of Dead Ladies"" ,  an 1869 translation of François Villon's poem ""Ballade des dames du temps jadis"" .   (The word ""yesteryear"" is credited to Rossetti as a neologism used for the first time in this translation . )In 1881 ,  Rossetti published a second volume of poems ,  Ballads and Sonnets ,  which included the remaining sonnets from The House of Life sequence .

As early as four years old ,  Sandridge began creating art ,  his first a stick person figure drawn in the family Bible .   He would later use whatever scraps of paper or materials his mother would give him ,  along with number two pencils ,  to imagine and draw .  Inventive for his age ,  he once took an old bed sheet and fashioned it into a canvas to draw a painting that he still has today . As a teenager ,  his passion and desire for art grew ,  especially when he was paid $15 for three sketched cartoons he submitted to The Alabama Sunday Weekly .  Convinced that he could make a living as an artist ,  he took his first job as a painter in the commercial display industry .     "

928,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/James_Abbott_McNeill_Whistler,James_Abbott_McNeill_Whistler,Artist_authors," James Abbott Whistler was born in Lowell ,  Massachusetts on July 11 ,  1834 , The family moved from Lowell to Stonington ,  Connecticut in 1837 ,  where his father worked for the Stonington Railroad .  Three of the couple's children died in infancy during this period . Whistler was a moody child prone to fits of temper and insolence ,  and he often drifted into periods of laziness after bouts of illness .  His parents discovered that drawing often settled him down and helped focus his attention . Beginning in 1842 ,  his father was employed to work on a railroad in Russia .  After moving to St .  Petersburg to join his father a year later ,  the young Whistler took private art lessons ,  then enrolled in the Imperial Academy of Arts at age eleven . In 1847–1848 ,  his family spent some time in London with relatives ,  while his father stayed in Russia .  Whistler's brother-in-law Francis Haden ,  a physician who was also an artist ,  spurred his interest in art and photography .  Haden took Whistler to visit collectors and to lectures ,  and gave him a watercolour set with instruction .  Whistler already was imagining an art career .  He began to collect books on art and he studied other artists' techniques .  When his portrait was painted by Sir William Boxall in 1848 ,  the young Whistler exclaimed that the portrait was ""very much like me and a very fine picture .  Mr .  Boxall is a beautiful colourist .  .  .  It is a beautiful creamy surface ,  and looks so rich . ""Whistler was sent to Christ Church Hall School with his mother's hopes that he would become a minister . His departure from West Point seems to have been precipitated by a failure in a chemistry exam where he was asked to describe silicon and began by saying ,  ""Silicon is a gas . "" As he himself put it later :  ""If silicon were a gas ,  I would have been a general one day"" . After West Point ,  Whistler worked as draftsman mapping the entire U . S .  coast for military and maritime purposes . At this point ,  Whistler firmly decided that art would be his future .  For a few months he lived in Baltimore with a wealthy friend ,  Tom Winans ,  who even furnished Whistler with a studio and some spending cash .  The young artist made some valuable contacts in the art community and also sold some early paintings to Winans .  Whistler turned down his mother's suggestions for other more practical careers and informed her that with money from Winans ,  he was setting out to further his art training in Paris .  Whistler never returned to the United States . Whistler arrived in Paris in 1855 ,  rented a studio in the Latin Quarter ,  and quickly adopted the life of a bohemian artist .  Soon he had a French girlfriend ,  a dressmaker named Héloise . Conditions improved during the summer of 1858 .  Whistler recovered and traveled with fellow artist Ernest Delannoy through France and the Rhineland .  He later produced a group of etchings known as ""The French Set"" ,  with the help of French master printer Auguste Delâtre .  During that year ,  he painted his first self-portrait ,  Portrait of Whistler with Hat ,  a dark and thickly rendered work reminiscent of Rembrandt . Also in this group was Charles Baudelaire ,  whose ideas and theories of ""modern"" art influenced Whistler .  Baudelaire challenged artists to scrutinize the brutality of life and nature and to portray it faithfully ,  avoiding the old themes of mythology and allegory . Reflecting the banner of realism of his adopted circle ,  Whistler painted his first exhibited work ,  La Mere Gerard in 1858 .  He followed it by painting At the Piano in 1859 in London ,  which he adopted as his home ,  while also regularly visiting friends in France .  At the Piano is a portrait composed of his niece and her mother in their London music room ,  an effort which clearly displayed his talent and promise .  A critic wrote ,  ""In a second painting executed in the same room ,  Whistler demonstrated his natural inclination toward innovation and novelty by fashioning a genre scene with unusual composition and foreshortening .  It later was re-titled Harmony in Green and Rose :  The Music Room . After a year in London ,  as counterpoint to his 1858 French set ,  in 1860 ,  he produced another set of etchings called Thames Set ,  as well as some early impressionistic work ,  including The Thames in Ice .   At this stage ,  he was beginning to establish his technique of tonal harmony based on a limited ,  pre-determined palette .     "

939,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Gheorghe_Asachi,Gheorghe_Asachi,Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing," Asachi was born in Hertsa ,  a small town which is now part of Ukraine .  His family originated in Austrian-ruled Transylvania ,  where it was known under the name Asachievici . In summer 1795 ,  after deciding not to send Gheorghe and Petru to Moldavian Greek-language school in the capital city of Iaşi ,  Lazăr Asachi opted to give them a more modern education in Austrian lands ,  sending them to Lemberg ,  where they attended gymnasium .  After completing seven terms of education in Latin ,  Polish and German ,  Gheorghe Asachi entered university (the present-day Lviv University) at the age of 14 .  He studied at the Faculty of Letters ,  Philosophy and Sciences (attending lectures in logic ,  metaphysics ,  ethics ,  mathematics ,  physics ,  natural history ,  and architecture) ,  but ,  in 1804 ,  after two years of studies ,  he withdrew and returned to Moldavia .  Despite this ,  his level of familiarity with Western culture was arguably unparalleled in his native country during the first half of the 19th century . His return followed the death of his mother and Lazăr Asachi's appointment as First Protopope of the Moldavian Metropolitan Seat ,  and saw the family settling in Iaşi . In early 1805 ,  Asachi fell ill with malaria ,  and was helped by Metropolitan Veniamin to leave for Vienna ,  where doctors had advised him to seek treatment .  As the recipient of a stately scholarship ,  Asachi studied mathematics and astronomy with Tobie Bürg ,  as well as pursuing training in the art of painting . His time in the city coincided with French Empire's successes in the Napoleonic Wars ,  and ,  most important ,  with the 1805 War of the Third Coalition ,  during which La Grande Armée occupied Vienna ;  this allowed Asachi to familiarize himself with French Revolutionary and liberal tenets ,  which he partly adopted in his political activities .  In 1808 ,  as the Russo-Turkish War erupted ,  Moldavia was occupied by the Russian Empire ,  First Protopope Lazăr contacted Pavel Chichagov to have his son appointed lieutenant and local head of the Corps of Engineers ,  but Gheorghe Asachi refused to assume office or even return from Vienna .  Instead ,  he left for the Italian Peninsula in April 1808 ,  aiming to complete his studies in Rome ,  but making long stops in other localities on the way (he notably visited Trieste ,  Venice ,  Padova ,  Ferrara ,  Bologna and Florence) .  Reaching the capital of the Papal States on 11 June ,  Asachi left on 19 August to visit Naples ,  Pompeii ,  and other locations in the Kingdom of Sicily .  Upon reaching Mount Vesuvius ,  he descended unaccompanied into the volcanic crater ,  and was encouraged by a cheering audience . He soon after returned to Rome ,  where he focused on studying Renaissance Latin and Italian literature ,  as well as taking classes in archeology ,  painting and sculpture ,  and entering his most prolific phase in visual arts .  In 1809 ,  while visiting an art shop near the Spanish Steps ,  he met Bianca Milesi ,  the 19-year-old daughter of a wealthy merchant from Milan ,  with whom he fell in love .  Despite her 1825 marriage to a French doctor ,  he was to remain her passionate admirer until her death from cholera in 1849 .  He later stressed that she had been a major source of inspiration for him ,  especially in allowing him the transition ""from painter to poet"" ,  while the literary critic Eugen Lovinescu believed she inspired Asachi's Romantic nationalism . At the time ,  he authored his first poems on Romanian nationalist subjects ,  which earned him an award presented by the Roman Literary Society .  One of these was Viitorul (""The Future"") ,  which voiced a call for national regeneration .  Interested in the origin of the Romanians and the history of Roman Dacia ,  Asachi studied events depicted on Trajan's Column and searched the Vatican Library for documents regarding the history of Romania .  It was during the latter research that he came across Dimitrie Cantemir's History of the Growth and Decay of the Ottoman Empire in its English-language edition . Through Bianca Milesi ,  Asachi met François Miollis ,  the French commander in Rome ,  who reportedly told him that Napoleon Bonaparte intended to emancipate Moldavia and Wallachia as a result of the expedition into Russia ,  and thus create a new ""Dacian Kingdom"" in the area of present-day Romania .  Partly as a result of this encouragement ,  Asachi decided to travel back home on 22 June 1812 ,  and ,  sailing down to Galaţi ,  arrived in Iaşi on 30 August .  His designs regarding French protection over the Danubian Principalities were ended by Napoleon's retreat from Russia ,  and by the restoration of Ottoman suzerainty and Phanariote rules ,  when Sultan Mahmud II appointed Scarlat Callimachi as Prince . In reaction to these developments ,  Gheorghe Asachi centered his attention on cultural improvements ,  Westernization ,  and Enlightenment teachings ,  with support from Metropolitan Veniamin .  In 1813 ,  his expertise and familiarity with European languages led Prince Callimachi to appoint him Reviewer (Referandar) for the Department of Foreign Affairs . In 1814 ,  increasingly opposed to the Greek-language teaching favored by the Phanariotes ,  Asachi proposed the first in a series of Romanian-language educational institutions ,  a course in engineering and topography to be held at the Princely Academy in Iaşi ; Nevertheless ,  Asachi was not stripped of his professorship ,  and was allowed to maintain both his position as head of the Princely Library and his house on Academy grounds .  Later in the same year ,  he was involved in reorganizing the Orthodox seminary at Iaşi's Socola Monastery ,  and traveled to Transylvania in order to enlist the help of scholars active there .  His friendly relations with various leaders of the Transylvanian School helped in achieving this goal ;  in 1820 ,  he returned to Moldavia accompanied by Vasile Fabian Bob ,  Ioan Costa ,  Ion Manfi and Vasile Pop ,  all of whom became teachers at the Academy . Early in 1821 ,  Gheorghe Asachi's activities were interrupted when the Greek Filiki Eteria forces crossed the Prut River and took over Moldavia on their way to Wallachia ,  during what constituted the earliest stage of the Greek War of Independence .  Like his father (who died in 1825) ,  Metropolitan Veniamin ,  and many other notable Moldavians ,  Asachi fled into Russian territory .  He returned the following year ,  as the Ottoman Empire retook the region and put an end to Phanariote rules (a measure which attracted Asachi's enthusiasm) ;  the new prince ,  Ioan Sturdza ,  appointed him Moldavian representative to the Austrian Empire ,  an office which he held between 30 November 1822 and February 1827 . While in Vienna ,  he met the Austrian woman Elena Tauber ,  former governess of the Sturdza children and widow of the merchant Kiriako Melirato ;  she was his concubine until 1827 ,  when they were married in an Orthodox church in Iaşi . Soon after returning ,  Asachi was appointed caretaker of all Moldavian schools and Vel Agha .  In March 1828 ,  he succeeded in opening a multilingual upper school and gymnasium ,  connected to the Trei Ierarhi Church ,  named Şcoala Vasiliană or Gimnaziul Vasilian (in honor of the 17th-century prince Vasile Lupu ,  who had created the original education institution on that site) .  It was the first modern institution of its kind in Moldavia ,  and was soon supplemented by a college . Upon the end of the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829 ,  Moldavia and Wallachia again came under Russian administration .  During that interval ,  Asachi decided to expand his educational goals and popularize new ideas through the means of press institutions ,  and requested approval from the Russian consul in Iaşi ,  Matvey Minciaky ,  to have these set up . Over the following decades ,  it oversaw the publishing of several other magazines ,  which were originally designed as supplements ; In addition ,  Asachi also issued a large panel of related works ,  including a series of almanacs which ran between 1847 and 1870 . In late 1829 ,  through a framework first outlined in the Akkerman Convention ,  Russian governor Peter Zheltukhin established a boards of experts from both countries ,  charged with drafting the constitutional project eventually known as Regulamentul Organic .  The project was delayed by the ongoing war and epidemics of cholera and bubonic plague until 1831–1832 ,  as Pavel Kiselyov took over for Zheltukhin ;  Gheorghe Asachi served as secretary of the Moldavian boardThe membership outlined for the Moldavian board scandalized the lesser boyars ,  who pointed out that the Akkerman treaties called for the new legislation to be adopted through a vote in a representative Boyar Divan ,  and who attempted to have Asachi and Conachi recalled . The trade regulations offered by the Regulament were welcomed with enthusiasm by Asachi ,  prompting him to write an ode in their honor ,  titled Annul nou al moldo-românilor 1830 ,  în care s-a lucrat Regulamentul organic ,  acel întâi cod administrativ al Moldovei (""The New Year of the Moldo-Romanians 1830 ,  in Which Regulamentul Organic ,  the First Administrative Code of Moldavia ,  Was Completed"") . Gheorghe Asachi was heavily impressed by the institutions he saw functioning in the Russian capital ,  and did his best to replicate them in Moldavia . In July of the same year ,  Asachi visited the Wallachian capital of Bucharest ,  being charged by Minciaky with strengthening the common framework of the Regulament by ensuring that its two versions did not differ in content . In late 1834 ,  on Asachi's request ,  Sturdza gave approval for the first Moldavian girls' school to be opened in the capital .  On 6 June 1835 ,  following Asachi's interventions ,  Academia Mihăileană ,  the first Romanian-language institution of higher education ,  was established in the city . On 15 November 1836 ,  he founded ,  alongside Vornic Ştefan Catargiu and Spătar Alecsandri (the father of poet Vasile Alecsandri) ,  a conservatory ,  and ,  after 1837 ,  was appointed head of the Moldavian Theater ,  among the first of its kind to showcase original pieces in Romanian . In 1847 ,  Asachi's printing press issued an Armenian-language primer . Over the same decade ,  Asachi moved towards Conservatism ,  defending Regulamentul Organic in front of the increasingly popular liberal current . The debate prolonged itself over the following years ,  and ,  coupled with Asachi's unwavering support for Sturdza ,  saw him joining the separatist camp at a time the post-revolutionary group Partida Naţională began openly campaigning for Moldo-Wallachian unification . Also in 1848 ,  Asachi lost his daughter ,  the 19-year-old Eufrosina ,  to the cholera outbreak . In January 1850 ,  almost one year after the Convention of Balta Liman awarded the Moldavian throne to the reform-minded and revolutionary sympathizer Grigore Alexandru Ghica ,  Albina Românească changed its name to Gazeta de Moldavia ,  adopting an official tone . During the political battles which followed Ghica's retirement and the Crimean War ,  Gazeta de Moldavia transformed itself into an official platform for the anti-unionist camp . As the Treaty of Paris imposed the creation of ad hoc Divans ,  through which the two countries' inhabitants were allowed to decide their future ,  the unionist camp saw a chance for fulfilling its goals ;  Asachi and his associates reacted vehemently ,  and ,  in May 1857 ,  complained to the Porte that unification would bring about various perils .  One month later ,  the government of Kaymakam Nicolae Vogoride carried out an electoral fraud to yield a separatist majority in the ad hoc Divan — Asachi ,  who supported Sturdza's bid for the throne ,  is thought to have played a major part in bringing this about ,  and ,  together with Vogoride himself ,  Nicolae Istrati ,  and the Austrian consul Oskar von Gödel-Lannoy ,  to have drawn up falsified the electoral lists . The suffrage was hotly contested and annulled through an agreement between the Second French Empire and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ;  Asachi himself was thus forced to note that the new elections in August managed to overturn the previous results . The situation changed in January 1859 ,  when Partida Naţională was able to ensure the election of Alexandru Ioan Cuza as both Prince of Moldavia and Prince of Wallachia ,  in what was the de facto union of the two countries .  After congratulating Cuza on his accomplishment ,  Asachi authored a pome titled Odă la Dumnezeu (""An Ode to God"") ,  which proclaimed the brotherhood of Romanians and the notion that ""power resides in Unity"" . The various projects also involved Asachi's own financial reserves ,  which led him to become indebted and mortgage his assets on several occasions :  in 1862 ,  after Asachi was declared insolvent ,  the Copou house was put up for auction ,  but the writer was able to come up with the money before the sale was perfected .

The children were raised in Couëron ,  near Nantes ,  France ,  by Audubon and his French wife ,  Anne Moynet Audubon ,  whom he had married years before his time in Saint-Domingue .  In 1794 they formally adopted both the children to regularize their legal status in France . From his earliest days ,  Audubon had an affinity for birds .  ""I felt an intimacy with them .  .  . bordering on frenzy  His father encouraged his interest in nature : He would point out the elegant movement of the birds ,  and the beauty and softness of their plumage .  He called my attention to their show of pleasure or sense of danger ,  their perfect forms and splendid attire .  He would speak of their departure and return with the seasons . In France during the chaotic years of the French Revolution and its aftermath ,  the younger Audubon grew up to be a handsome and gregarious man .  He played flute and violin ,  and learned to ride ,  fence ,  and dance .    Audubon made some excursions out West where he hoped to record Western species he had missed ,  but his health began to fail .  In 1848 ,  he manifested signs of senility or possibly dementia from what is now called Alzheimer's disease ,  his ""noble mind in ruins"" . Audubon's final work dealt with mammals ;  he prepared The Viviparous Quadrupeds of North America (1845–1849) in collaboration with his good friend Rev .  John Bachman of Charleston ,  South Carolina ,  who supplied much of the scientific text .  His son ,  John Woodhouse Audubon ,  drew most of the plates .  The work was completed by Audubon's sons ,  and the second volume was published posthumously in 1851 .  "

952,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Quentin_Blake,Quentin_Blake,Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing," Blake was born in 1932 in Sidcup ,  Kent ,  and was evacuated to the West Country during the Second World War .  He attended Holy Trinity Lamorbey Church of England Primary School and Chislehurst and Sidcup Grammar School ,  where his English teacher ,  J .  H .  Walsh ,  influenced him into literature .  His artistic development during his school years was helped by contact with the painter and cartoonist Alfred Jackson ,  the husband of Blake's Latin teacher ,  who encouraged his first submissions to Punch ,  resulting in his first publication at the age of 16 .  In the sixth form ,  the school's art teacher ,  the painter Stanley Simmonds recognized Blake's talents and provided support and exposure to the work of other artists .   During the 1960s ,  Blake taught English at the Lycée Français de Londres which cemented his long association with France and culminated in the award of the Legion of Honour .  He taught at the Royal College of Art for over twenty years ,  where he was head of the Illustration department from 1978 to 1986 . The first book that Blake illustrated was The Wonderful Button by Evan Hunter ,  published by Abelard-Schuman in 1961 .  To date ,  Blake has illustrated two of David Walliams' books and has illustrated Folio Society Limited Editions such as Don Quixote ,  Candide and 50 Fables of La Fontaine . In the 1970s ,  Blake was an occasional presenter of the BBC children's story-telling programme Jackanory ,  when he would illustrate the stories on a canvas as he was telling them .  In 1993 ,  he designed the five British Christmas issue postage stamps featuring episodes from A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens . Blake is a member of the Chelsea Arts Club .  In 2007 ,  he designed a huge mural on fabric ,  suspended over and thus disguising a ramshackle building immediately opposite an entrance to St Pancras railway station .  The rendering of an ""imaginary welcoming committee"" greets passengers arriving on the Eurostar high-speed railway . Blake is a supporter of and ambassador for the indigenous rights NGO Survival International .  In 2009 ,  he said ,  ""For me ,  Survival is important for two reasons ;  one is that I think it’s right that we should give help and support to people who are threatened by the rapacious industrial society we have created ;  and the other that ,  more generally ,  it gives an important signal about how we all ought to be looking after the world .  Its message is the most fundamental of any charity I'm connected with . ""Blake is the Founding Trustee of House of Illustration ,  a centre in London for exhibitions ,  educational events and activities related to the art of illustration .  He was also the subject of the first exhibition at this venue ,  entitled Inside Stories"" ,  which opened in July 2014 .  In August 2020 ,  it was announced that the centre will be relocating to the 18th century Engine House at New River Head in the Clerkenwell area of London ,  and will be renamed the Quentin Blake Centre for Illustration . Besides children's books ,  Blake is also the designer of Ben ,  the logo of the shop chain Ben's Cookies .   He designed several illustrations for the story time segments for the Scottish TV series Squeak! .    "
953,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/William_Blake,William_Blake,Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing," William Blake was born on 28 November 1757 at 28 Broad Street (now Broadwick St . ) in Soho ,  London .  He was the third of seven children ,  The Bible was an early and profound influence on Blake ,  and remained a source of inspiration throughout his life . Blake started engraving copies of drawings of Greek antiquities purchased for him by his father ,  a practice that was preferred to actual drawing .  Within these drawings Blake found his first exposure to classical forms through the work of Raphael ,  Michelangelo ,  Maarten van Heemskerck and Albrecht Dürer .  The number of prints and bound books that James and Catherine were able to purchase for young William suggests that the Blakes enjoyed ,  at least for a time ,  a comfortable wealth .  He read avidly on subjects of his own choosing .  During this period ,  Blake made explorations into poetry ;  his early work displays knowledge of Ben Jonson ,  Edmund Spenser ,  and the Psalms . On 4 August 1772 ,  Blake was apprenticed to engraver James Basire of Great Queen Street ,  at the sum of £52 . 10 ,  for a term of seven years . After two years ,  Basire sent his apprentice to copy images from the Gothic churches in London (perhaps to settle a quarrel between Blake and James Parker ,  his fellow apprentice) .  His experiences in Westminster Abbey helped form his artistic style and ideas .  The Abbey of his day was decorated with suits of armour ,  painted funeral effigies and varicoloured waxworks .  Ackroyd notes that "" .  .  . the most immediate On 8 October 1779 ,  Blake became a student at the Royal Academy in Old Somerset House ,  near the Strand .  Blake also disliked Reynolds' apparent humility ,  which he held to be a form of hypocrisy .  Against Reynolds' fashionable oil painting ,  Blake preferred the Classical precision of his early influences ,  Michelangelo and Raphael . David Bindman suggests that Blake's antagonism towards Reynolds arose not so much from the president's opinions (like Blake ,  Reynolds held history painting to be of greater value than landscape and portraiture) ,  but rather ""against his hypocrisy in not putting his ideals into practice . "" Certainly Blake was not averse to exhibiting at the Royal Academy ,  submitting works on six occasions between 1780 and 1808 . Blake became a friend of John Flaxman ,  Thomas Stothard and George Cumberland during his first year at the Royal Academy .  They shared radical views ,  with Stothard and Cumberland joining the Society for Constitutional Information . Blake's first biographer ,  Alexander Gilchrist ,  records that in June 1780 Blake was walking towards Basire's shop in Great Queen Street when he was swept up by a rampaging mob that stormed Newgate Prison .  The mob attacked the prison gates with shovels and pickaxes ,  set the building ablaze ,  and released the prisoners inside .  Blake was reportedly in the front rank of the mob during the attack .  The riots ,  in response to a parliamentary bill revoking sanctions against Roman Catholicism ,  became known as the Gordon Riots and provoked a flurry of legislation from the government of George III ,  and the creation of the first police force .   Blake met Catherine Boucher in 1782 when he was recovering from a relationship that had culminated in a refusal of his marriage proposal .  He recounted the story of his heartbreak for Catherine and her parents ,  after which he asked Catherine ,  ""Do you pity me?"" When she responded affirmatively ,  he declared ,  ""Then I love you . "" Blake married Catherine – who was five years his junior – on 18 August 1782 in St Mary's Church ,  Battersea .  Illiterate ,  Catherine signed her wedding contract with an X .  The original wedding certificate may be viewed at the church ,  where a commemorative stained-glass window was installed between 1976 and 1982 .  Later ,  in addition to teaching Catherine to read and write ,  Blake trained her as an engraver .  Throughout his life she proved a valuable aid ,  helping to print his illuminated works and maintaining his spirits throughout numerous misfortunes . Blake's first collection of poems ,  Poetical Sketches ,  was printed around 1783 .  early feminist Mary Wollstonecraft and English revolutionary Thomas Paine .  Along with William Wordsworth and William Godwin ,  Blake had great hopes for the French and American revolutions and wore a Phrygian cap in solidarity with the French revolutionaries ,  but despaired with the rise of Robespierre and the Reign of Terror in France .  In 1784 Blake composed his unfinished manuscript An Island in the Moon . Blake illustrated Original Stories from Real Life (2nd edition ,  1791) by Mary Wollstonecraft .  They seem to have shared some views on sexual equality and the institution of marriage ,  but there is no evidence proving that they met .  In 1793's Visions of the Daughters of Albion ,  Blake condemned the cruel absurdity of enforced chastity and marriage without love and defended the right of women to complete self-fulfilment . From 1790 to 1800 ,  William Blake lived in North Lambeth ,  London ,  at 13 Hercules Buildings ,  Hercules Road . In 1788 ,  aged 31 ,  Blake experimented with relief etching ,  a method he used to produce most of his books ,  paintings ,  pamphlets and poems .  The process is also referred to as illuminated printing ,  and the finished products as illuminated books or prints .  Illuminated printing involved writing the text of the poems on copper plates with pens and brushes ,  using an acid-resistant medium .  Illustrations could appear alongside words in the manner of earlier illuminated manuscripts .  He then etched the plates in acid to dissolve the untreated copper and leave the design standing in relief (hence the name) . This is a reversal of the usual method of etching ,  where the lines of the design are exposed to the acid ,  and the plate printed by the intaglio method .  Relief etching (which Blake referred to as ""stereotype"" in The Ghost of Abel) was intended as a means for producing his illuminated books more quickly than via intaglio .  Stereotype ,  a process invented in 1725 ,  consisted of making a metal cast from a wood engraving ,  but Blake's innovation was ,  as described above ,  very different .  The pages printed from these plates were hand-coloured in watercolours and stitched together to form a volume .  Blake used illuminated printing for most of his well-known works ,  including Songs of Innocence and of Experience ,  The Book of Thel ,  The Marriage of Heaven and Hell and Jerusalem . Although Blake has become better known for his relief etching ,  his commercial work largely consisted of intaglio engraving ,  the standard process of engraving in the 18th century in which the artist incised an image into the copper plate ,  a complex and laborious process ,  with plates taking months or years to complete ,  but as Blake's contemporary ,  John Boydell ,  realised ,  such engraving offered a ""missing link with commerce"" ,  enabling artists to connect with a mass audience and became an immensely important activity by the end of the 18th century . Europe Supported by Africa and America is an engraving by Blake held in the collection of the University of Arizona Museum of Art .  The engraving was for a book written by Blake's friend John Gabriel Stedman called The Narrative of a Five Years Expedition against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam (1796) . Blake employed intaglio engraving in his own work ,  such as for his Illustrations of the Book of Job ,  completed just before his death .  Most critical work has concentrated on Blake's relief etching as a technique because it is the most innovative aspect of his art ,  but a 2009 study drew attention to Blake's surviving plates ,  including those for the Book of Job :  they demonstrate that he made frequent use of a technique known as ""repoussage"" ,  a means of obliterating mistakes by hammering them out by hitting the back of the plate .  Such techniques ,  typical of engraving work of the time ,  are very different from the much faster and fluid way of drawing on a plate that Blake employed for his relief etching ,  and indicates why the engravings took so long to complete .

955,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Ray_Bradbury,Ray_Bradbury,Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing," Bradbury was born on August 22 ,  1920 ,  in Waukegan ,  Illinois ,  to Esther (née Moberg) Bradbury (1888–1966) ,  a Swedish immigrant ,  and Leonard Spaulding Bradbury (1890–1957) ,  a power and telephone lineman of English ancestry .  He was given the middle name ""Douglas"" after the actor Douglas Fairbanks .  Bradbury was surrounded by an extended family during his early childhood and formative years in Waukegan .  An aunt read him short stories when he was a child .  This period provided foundations for both the author and his stories .  In Bradbury's works of fiction ,  1920s Waukegan becomes ""Green Town"" ,  Illinois . The Bradbury family lived in Tucson ,  Arizona ,  during 1926–1927 and 1932–1933 while their father pursued employment ,  each time returning to Waukegan .  While living in Tucson ,  Bradbury attended Amphi Junior High School and Roskruge Junior High School .  They eventually settled in Los Angeles in 1934 when Bradbury was 14 years old .  The family arrived with only US$40 (equivalent to $774 in 2020) ,  which paid for rent and food until his father finally found a job making wire at a cable company for $14 a week (equivalent to $271 in 2020) .  This meant that they could stay ,  and Bradbury ,  who was in love with Hollywood ,  was ecstatic . Bradbury attended Los Angeles High School and was active in the drama club .  He often roller-skated through Hollywood in hopes of meeting celebrities .  Among the creative and talented people Bradbury met were special-effects pioneer Ray Harryhausen and radio star George Burns .  Bradbury's first pay as a writer ,  at age 14 ,  was for a joke he sold to George Burns to use on the  Burns and Allen radio show .   Bradbury's first published story was ""Hollerbochen's Dilemma"" ,  which appeared in the January 1938 number of Forrest J .  Ackerman's fanzine Imagination! . Bradbury was free to start a career in writing when ,  owing to his bad eyesight ,  he was rejected for induction into the military during World War II .  Having been inspired by science-fiction heroes such as Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers ,  Bradbury began to publish science-fiction stories in fanzines in 1938 .  Bradbury was invited by Forrest J .  AckermanIn 1939 ,  Bradbury joined Laraine Day's Wilshire Players Guild ,  where for two years ,  he wrote and acted in several plays .  They were ,  as Bradbury later described ,  ""so incredibly bad"" that he gave up playwriting for two decades . Bradbury sold his first solo story ,  ""The Lake"" ,  for $13 . 75 at 22 and became a full-time writer by 24 . After a rejection notice from the pulp Weird Tales ,  Bradbury submitted ""Homecoming"" to Mademoiselle ,  which was spotted by a young editorial assistant named Truman Capote .  Capote picked the Bradbury manuscript from a slush pile ,  which led to its publication .  Homecoming won a place in the O .  Henry Award Stories of 1947 . In UCLA's Powell Library ,  in a study room with typewriters for rent ,  Bradbury wrote his classic story of a book burning future ,  The Fireman ,  which was about 25 , 000 words long .  It was later published at about 50 , 000 words under the name Fahrenheit 451 ,  for a total cost of $9 . 80 ,  due to the library's typewriter-rental fees of ten cents per half-hour . A chance encounter in a Los Angeles bookstore with the British expatriate writer Christopher Isherwood gave Bradbury the opportunity to put The Martian Chronicles into the hands of a respected critic .  Isherwood's glowing review followed .  Bradbury died in Los Angeles ,  California ,  on June 5 ,  2012 ,  at the age of 91 ,  after a lengthy illness . The New York Times called Bradbury ""the writer most responsible for bringing modern science fiction into the literary mainstream . ""On June 6 ,  2012 ,  in an official public statement from the White House Press Office ,  President Barack Obama said :  For many Americans ,  the news of Ray Bradbury's death immediately brought to mind images from his work ,  imprinted in our minds ,  often from a young age .  His gift for storytelling reshaped our culture and expanded our world .  But Ray also understood that our imaginations could be used as a tool for better understanding ,  a vehicle for change ,  and an expression of our most cherished values .  There is no doubt that Ray will continue to inspire many more generations with his writing ,  and our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends . Numerous Bradbury fans paid tribute to the author ,  noting the influence of his works on their own careers and creations .  "

957,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Raymond_Briggs,Raymond_Briggs,Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing," Raymond Briggs was born in Wimbledon ,  London ,  to parents Ernest Redvers Briggs (1900–1971) ,  a milkman ,  and Ethel Bowyer (1895–1971) ,  a former lady's maid-turned-housewife ,  who married in 1930 . He attended Rutlish School ,  at that time a grammar school ,  pursued cartooning from an early age and ,  despite his father's attempts to discourage him from this unprofitable pursuit ,  attended the Wimbledon School of Art from 1949 to 1953 to study painting ,  and Central School of Art to study typography . From 1953 to 1955 ,  he was a National Service conscript in the Royal Corps of Signals at Catterick ,  where he was made a draughtsman .  After this ,  he returned to study painting at Slade School of Fine Art at University College ,  London ,  graduating in 1957 .   After briefly pursuing painting ,  he became a professional illustrator ,  and soon began working in children's books .  In 1958 ,  he illustrated Peter and the Piskies :  Cornish Folk and Fairy Tales ,  a fairy tale anthology by Ruth Manning-Sanders that was published by Oxford University Press .  They would collaborate again for the Hamish Hamilton Book of Magical Beasts (Hamilton ,  1966) .  In 1961 ,  Briggs began teaching illustration part-time at Brighton School of Art ,  which he continued until 1986 ; The first three important works that Briggs both wrote and illustrated were in comics format rather than the separate text and illustrations typical of children's books ;  all three were published by Hamish Hamilton .  Father Christmas (1973) and its sequel Father Christmas Goes on Holiday (1975) both feature a curmudgeonly Father Christmas who complains incessantly about the ""blooming snow"" .  For the former ,  he won his second Greenaway .  Much later they were jointly adapted as a film titled Father Christmas .  The third early Hamilton ""comics"" was Fungus the Bogeyman (1977) ,  featuring one day in the life of a working class Bogeyman with the mundane job of scaring human beings . The Snowman (Hamilton ,  1978) was entirely wordless ,  and illustrated with only pencil crayons . An American edition was produced by Random House in the same year ,  for which Briggs won the Boston Globe–Horn Book Award ,  picture book category .  In 1982 ,  it was adapted by British TV channel Channel 4 as an animated cartoon ,  which was nominated for the annual ""Oscar"" and has since been shown every year (except 1984) on British television .  On Christmas Eve 2012 the 30th anniversary of the original was marked by the airing of the sequel The Snowman and the Snowdog . Briggs continued to work in a similar format ,  but with more adult content ,  in Gentleman Jim (1980) ,  a sombre look at the working class trials of Jim and Hilda Bloggs ,  closely based on his parents .  When the Wind Blows (1982) confronted the trusting ,  optimistic Bloggs couple with the horror of nuclear war ,  and was praised in the British House of Commons for its timeliness and originality .  The topic was inspired after Briggs watched a Panorama documentary on nuclear contingency planning ,  The Tin-Pot Foreign General and the Old Iron Woman (1984) was a scathing denunciation of the Falklands War .  Briggs continued to produce humour for children ,  in works such as the Unlucky Wally series and The Bear .   "

Brom has been drawing and painting since childhood ,  although he had never taken any formal art classes .  ""I wouldn't exactly call myself self-taught ,  because I've always looked at the work of other artists and emulated what I liked about it .  So you can say they taught me . "" Brom cites the work of Frank Frazetta ,  N . C .  Wyeth ,  and Norman Rockwell as influences on his style :  ""Okay .  .  .  Rockwell isn't the kind of inspiration most people expect from me ,  but he just painted things so well .  To me it's not so much the genre but the way it's done ,  and you have to admire his technique . ""  At the age of 20 ,  Brom started working full-time as a commercial illustrator .  By age twenty-one ,  he had two national art representatives ,  and was doing work for such clients as Coca-Cola ,  IBM ,  CNN ,  and Columbia Pictures .

964,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Tim_Burton,Tim_Burton,Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing," Burton was born on August 25 ,  1958 ,  in Burbank ,  California ,  the son of Jean Burton (née Erickson ,  1933–2002) ,  later the owner of a cat-themed gift shop ,  and William ""Bill"" Burton (1930–2000) ,  a former minor league baseball player who was working for the Burbank Parks and Recreation Department .   Stalk of the Celery Monster attracted the attention of Walt Disney Productions' animation division ,  which offered Burton an animator's apprenticeship at the studio .  He worked as an animator ,  storyboard artist ,  graphic designer ,  art director ,  and concept artist on films such as The Fox and the Hound (1981) ,  Tron (1982) ,  and The Black Cauldron (1985) .  His concept art never made it into the finished films . While at Disney in 1982 ,  Burton made his first short ,  Vincent ,  a six-minute black-and-white stop motion film based on a poem written by Burton ,  which depicts a young boy who fantasizes that he is his hero Vincent Price ,  with Price himself providing narration .  The film was produced by Rick Heinrichs ,  whom Burton had befriended while working in the concept art department at Disney .  The film was shown at the Chicago Film Festival and released ,  alongside the teen drama Tex ,  for two weeks in one Los Angeles cinema .  This was followed by Burton's first live-action production ,  Hansel and Gretel ,  a Japanese-themed adaptation of the Brothers Grimm fairy tale for the Disney Channel ,  which climaxes in a kung fu fight between Hansel and Gretel and the witch .  Having aired once in 1983 at 10 : 30 pm on Halloween and promptly shelved ,  prints of the film are extremely difficult to locate ,  fueling rumors that the project did not exist .  The short would finally go on public display in 2009 at the Museum of Modern Art ,  and again in 2011 as part of the Tim Burton art exhibit at LACMA . Burton's next live-action short film ,  Frankenweenie ,  was released in 1984 .  It tells the story of a young boy who tries to revive his dog after it is run over by a car .  Filmed in black-and-white ,  it stars Barret Oliver ,  Shelley Duvall (with whom he would work again in 1986 ,  directing an episode of her television series Faerie Tale Theatre) ,  and Daniel Stern .  After Frankenweenie was completed ,  Disney fired Burton ,  under the pretext of him spending the company's resources on a film that would be too dark and scary for children to see . Actor Paul Reubens saw Frankenweenie and chose Burton to direct the cinematic spin-off of his popular character Pee-wee Herman ,  stating on the audio commentary of 2000 DVD release of Pee-wee's Big Adventure that as soon as the short began ,  he was sold on Burton's style .  Pee-wee Herman gained mainstream popularity with a successful stage show at The Groundlings and the Roxy which was later turned into an HBO special .  The film ,  Pee-wee's Big Adventure ,  was made on a budget of $8million and grossed more than $40million at the North American box office .  Burton ,  a fan of the eccentric musical group Oingo Boingo ,  asked songwriter Danny Elfman to provide the music for the film .  Since then ,  Elfman has scored every film that Tim Burton has directed ,  except for Ed Wood ,  Sweeney Todd :  The Demon Barber of Fleet Street ,  and Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children . After directing episodes for the revitalized version of '50s/'60s anthology horror series Alfred Hitchcock Presents and Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre ,  Burton directed his next big project :  Beetlejuice (1988) ,  a supernatural comedy horror about a young couple forced to cope with life after death and the family of pretentious yuppies who invade their treasured New England home .  Their teenage daughter ,  Lydia (Winona Ryder) ,  has an obsession with death which allows her to see the deceased couple .  Starring Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis ,  and featuring Michael Keaton as the obnoxious bio-exorcist Beetlejuice ,  the film grossed $80million on a relatively low budget and won an Academy Award for Best Makeup .  It would be converted into a cartoon of the same name ,  with Burton playing a role as executive producer ,  that ran on ABC and later Fox . Burton's ability to produce hits with low budgets impressed studio executives ,  and he received his first big budget film ,  Batman .  The production was plagued with problems .  Burton repeatedly clashed with the film's producers ,  Jon Peters and Peter Guber ,  but the most notable debacle involved casting .  For the title role ,  Burton chose to cast Michael Keaton as Batman following their previous collaboration in Beetlejuice ,  despite Keaton's average physique ,  inexperience with action films ,  and reputation as a comic actor .  Although Burton won in the end ,  the furor over the casting provoked enormous fan animosity ,  to the extent that Warner Brothers' share price slumped .  Burton had considered it ridiculous to cast a ""bulked-up"" ultra-masculine man as Batman ,  insisting that Batman should be an ordinary man who dressed up in an elaborate bat costume to frighten criminals .  Burton cast Jack Nicholson as The Joker (Tim Curry being his second choice) in a move that helped assuage fans' fears ,  as well as attracting older audiences not as interested in a superhero film .  When the film opened in June 1989 ,  it was backed by the biggest marketing and merchandising campaign in film history at the time ,  and became one of the biggest box office hits of all time ,  grossing over $250million in the U . S .  and $400million worldwide (numbers not adjusted for inflation) and earning critical acclaim for the performances of both Keaton and Nicholson ,  as well as the film's production aspects ,  which won the Academy Award for Best Art Direction .  The success of the film helped establish Burton as a profitable director ,  and it proved to be a huge influence on future superhero films ,  which eschewed the bright ,  all-American heroism of Richard Donner's Superman for a grimmer ,  more realistic look and characters with more psychological depth .  It also became a major inspiration for the successful 1990s cartoon Batman :  The Animated Series ,  as the darkness of Burton's film and its sequel allowed for a darker Batman on television . Burton claimed that the graphic novel Batman :  The Killing Joke was a major influence on his film adaptation of Batman : ""I was never a giant comic book fan ,  but I've always loved the image of Batman and the Joker .  The reason I've never been a comic book fan– and I think it started when I was a child– is because I could never tell which box I was supposed to read .  I don't know if it was dyslexia or whatever ,  but that's why I loved The Killing Joke ,  because for the first time I could tell which one to read .  It's my favorite .  It's the first comic I've ever loved .  And the success of those graphic novels made our ideas more acceptable . ""In 1990 ,  Burton co-wrote (with Caroline Thompson) and directed Edward Scissorhands ,  re-uniting with Winona Ryder from Beetlejuice .  His friend Johnny Depp ,  a teen idol at the end of the 1980s due primarily to his work on the hit TV series 21 Jump Street ,  was cast in the title role of Edward ,  who was the creation of an eccentric and old-fashioned inventor (played by Vincent Price in one of his last screen appearances) .  Edward looked human ,  but was left with scissors in the place of hands due to the untimely death of his creator .  Set in suburbia (and shot in Land o' Lakes ,  Florida) ,  the film is largely seen as Burton's autobiography of his childhood in Burbank .  Burton's idea Burton has stated that this is his most personal and meaningful film because it's a representation of him not being able to communicate effectively with others as a teenager . After the success of Batman ,  Burton agreed to direct the sequel for Warner Bros .  on the condition that he would be granted total control .  The result was Batman Returns ,  which featured Michael Keaton returning as Batman ,  and a new triad of villains :  Danny DeVito (as the Penguin) ,  Michelle Pfeiffer (as Catwoman) and Christopher Walken (as Max Shreck ,  an evil corporate tycoon and original character created for the film) .  Darker and considerably more personal than its predecessor ,  concerns were raised that the film was too scary for children .  Audiences were more uncomfortable at the film's overt sexuality ,  personified by the sleek ,  fetish-inspired styling of Catwoman's costume .  Burton made many changes to the Penguin which would subsequently be applied to the character in both comics and television .  While in the comics ,  he was an ordinary man ,  Burton created a freak of nature resembling a penguin with webbed ,  flipper-like fingers ,  a hooked ,  beak-like nose ,  and a penguin-like body (resulting in a rotund ,  obese man) .  Released in 1992 ,  Batman Returns grossed $282 . 8million worldwide ,  making it a financial success ,  though not to the extent of its predecessor . Due to schedule constraints on Batman Returns ,  Burton produced ,  but did not direct ,  The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) for Disney ,  originally meant to be a children's book in rhyme .  The film was directed by Henry Selick and written by Caroline Thompson ,  based on Burton's original story ,  world ,  and characters .  The film received positive reviews for the stop motion animation ,  musical score ,  and original storyline .  It was a box office success ,  grossing $50million .  Because of the nature of the film ,  it was not produced under Disney's name ,  but rather Disney owned Touchstone Pictures .  Disney wanted the protagonist to have eyes ,  Burton collaborated with Selick again for James and the Giant Peach (1996) ,  which Burton co-produced . In 1994 ,  Burton and frequent co-producer Denise Di Novi produced the 1994 fantasy-comedy Cabin Boy ,  starring comedian Chris Elliott and directed/written by Adam Resnick .  Burton was originally supposed to direct the film after seeing Elliott perform on Get a Life ,  but he handed the directing responsibility to Resnick once he was offered Ed Wood .  Burton's next film ,  Ed Wood (1994) ,  was of a much smaller scale ,  depicting the life of infamous director Ed Wood .  Starring Johnny Depp in the title role ,  the film is an homage to the low-budget science fiction and horror films of Burton's childhood and handles its comical protagonist and his motley band of collaborators with surprising fondness and sensitivity .  Owing to creative squabbles during the making of The Nightmare Before Christmas ,  Danny Elfman declined to score Ed Wood ,  and the assignment went to Howard Shore .  While a commercial failure at the time of its release ,  Ed Wood was well received by critics .  Martin Landau received the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi ,  and the film received the Academy Award for Best Makeup . Despite Burton's intention to still lead the Batman franchise ,  Warner Bros .  considered Batman Returns too dark and unsafe for children .  To attract the young audience ,  it was decided that Joel Schumacher ,  who had directed films like The Client ,  would lead the third film ,  while Burton would only produce it in conjunction with Peter MacGregor-Scott .  Following this change and the changes made by the new director ,  Michael Keaton resigned from the lead role and was replaced by Val Kilmer .  Filming for Batman Forever began in late 1994 with new actors :  Tommy Lee Jones as Harvey Dent/Two-Face ,  Nicole Kidman as Dr .  Chase Meridian ,  Chris O'Donnell as Dick Grayson/Robin and Jim Carrey as Edward Nygma/The Riddler ;  the only two actors who returned after Batman Returns were Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon and Michael Gough as Alfred Pennyworth .  The film ,  a combination of the darkness that characterized the saga and colors and neon signs proposed by Schumacher ,  was a huge box office success ,  earning $336million .  Warner Bros .  demanded that Schumacher delete some scenes so the film did not have the same tone as its predecessor ,  Batman Returns (later they were added as deleted scenes on the 2005 DVD release) . In 1996 ,  Burton and Selick reunited for the musical fantasy James and the Giant Peach ,  based on the book by Roald Dahl which contains magical elements and references to drugs and alcohol .  The film ,  a combination of live action and stop motion footage ,  starred Richard Dreyfuss ,  Susan Sarandon ,  David Thewlis ,  Simon Callow and Jane Leeves among others ,  with Burton producing and Selick directing .  The film was mostly praised by critics and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score (by Randy Newman) . Elfman and Burton reunited for Mars Attacks! (1996) .  Based on a popular science-fiction trading card series ,  the film was a hybrid of 1950s science fiction and 1970s all-star disaster films .  Coincidence made it an inadvertent spoof of the blockbuster Independence Day ,  which had been released five months earlier .  The film boasted an all-star cast ,  including Jack Nicholson ,  Glenn Close ,  Annette Bening ,  Danny DeVito ,  Pierce Brosnan ,  Michael J .  Fox ,  Sarah Jessica Parker ,  Natalie Portman ,  Lukas Haas ,  Martin Short ,  Rod Steiger ,  Christina Applegate ,  and Jack Black . Sleepy Hollow ,  released in late 1999 ,  had a supernatural setting and starred Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane ,  a detective with an interest in forensic science rather than the schoolteacher of Washington Irving's original tale .  With Sleepy Hollow ,  Burton paid homage to the horror films of the English company Hammer Films .  Christopher Lee ,  one of Hammer's stars ,  was given a cameo role .  A host of Burton regulars appeared in supporting roles (Michael Gough ,  Jeffrey Jones ,  and Christopher Walken ,  among others) ,  and Christina Ricci was cast as Katrina van Tassel .  A well-regarded supporting cast was headed by Miranda Richardson ,  Michael Gambon ,  Richard Griffiths and Ian McDiarmid .  Mostly well received by critics ,  and with a special mention to Elfman's gothic score ,  the film won an Academy Award for Best Art Direction ,  as well as two BAFTAs for Best Costume Design and Best Production Design .  A box office success ,  Sleepy Hollow was also a turning point for Burton .  Along with change in his personal life (separation from actress Lisa Marie) ,  Burton changed radically in style for his next project ,  leaving the haunted forests and colorful outcasts behind to go on to directing Planet of the Apes which ,  as Burton had repeatedly noted ,  was ""not a remake"" of the earlier film . Planet of the Apes was a commercial success ,  grossing $68million in its opening weekend .  The film has received mixed reviews and is widely considered inferior to the first adaptation of the novel .  In 2003 ,  Burton directed Big Fish ,  based on the novel Big Fish :  A Novel of Mythic Proportions by Daniel Wallace .  The film is about a father telling the story of his life to his son using exaggeration and color .  Starring Ewan McGregor as young Edward Bloom and Albert Finney as an older Edward Bloom ,  the film also stars Jessica Lange ,  Billy Crudup ,  Danny DeVito ,  Alison Lohman and Marion Cotillard .  Big Fish received four Golden Globe nominations as well as an Academy Award nomination for Elfman's score .  The film was also the second collaboration between Burton and Helena Bonham Carter ,  who played the characters of Jenny and the Witch ,  and Burton and Danny DeVito ,  who played Amos Calloway the circus ringleader . Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) is an adaptation of the book of the same name by Roald Dahl .  Starring Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka ,  Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket ,  and Deep Roy as the Oompa-Loompas ,  the film generally took a more faithful approach to the source material than the 1971 adaptation ,  Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory ,  although some liberties were taken ,  such as adding Wonka's issue with his father (played by Christopher Lee) .  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was later nominated for the Academy Award for Best Costume Design .  The film made over $207million domestically .  Filming proved difficult as Burton ,  Depp ,  and Danny Elfman had to work on this and Burton's Corpse Bride (2005) at the same time ,  which was Burton's first full-length stop motion film as a director ,  featuring the voices of Johnny Depp as Victor and Helena Bonham Carter as Emily  .

Burton's work on Sweeney Todd won the National Board of Review Award for Best Director ,  and won an Academy Award for Best Art Direction .  The film blends explicit gore and Broadway tunes ,  and was well received by critics .  Johnny Depp's performance as Sweeney Todd was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor . In 2005 ,  filmmaker Shane Acker released his short film 9 ,  a story about a sentient rag doll living in a post-apocalyptic world who tries to stop machines from destroying the rest of his eight fellow rag dolls .  The film won numerous awards and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film .  After seeing the short film ,  Tim Burton and Timur Bekmambetov ,  director of Wanted ,  showed interest in producing a feature-length adaptation of the film .  Directed by Acker ,  the full-length film was produced by Burton ,  written by Acker (story) and Pamela Pettler (screenplay ,  co-writer of Corpse Bride) ,  and featured the voice work of Elijah Wood ,  John C .  Reilly ,  Jennifer Connelly ,  Christopher Plummer ,  Martin Landau ,  and Crispin Glover ,  among others . Tim Burton appeared at the 2009 Comic-Con in San Diego ,  California ,  to promote both 9 and Alice in Wonderland ;  the latter won two Academy Awards ,  for Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design .  In Burton's version of Alice in Wonderland ,  the story is set 13 years after the original Lewis Carroll tales .  Mia Wasikowska was cast as Alice .  The original start date for filming was May 2008 . Dark Shadows once again saw the collaboration of Burton with actors Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter ,  composer Danny Elfman ,  and costume designer Colleen Atwood .  The film was released on May 11 ,  2012 ,  and received mixed reviews from critics .  Burton co-produced Abraham Lincoln :  Vampire Hunter with Timur Bekmambetov ,  who also served as director (they previously worked together in 9) .  The film ,  released on June 22 ,  2012 ,  was based on the novel by Seth Grahame-Smith ,  who wrote the film's screenplay and also authored Pride and Prejudice and Zombies .  The film starred Benjamin Walker as Abraham Lincoln ,  Anthony Mackie as William H .  Johnson ,  Joseph Mawle as Lincoln's father Thomas ,  Robin McLeavy as Lincoln's mother ,  Nancy ,  and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Lincoln's love interest (and later wife) ,  Mary Ann Todd .  The film received mixed reviews . Burton directed the 2014 biographical drama film Big Eyes about American artist Margaret Keane (Amy Adams) ,  whose work was fraudulently claimed in the 1950s and 1960s by her then-husband ,  Walter Keane (Christoph Waltz) ,  and their heated divorce trial after Margaret accused Walter of stealing credit for her paintings .  The script was written by the screenwriters behind Burton's Ed Wood ,  Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski .  Filming began in Vancouver ,  British Columbia ,  in mid-2013 .  The film was distributed by The Weinstein Company and released in U . S .  theaters on December 25 ,  2014 .  It received generally positive reviews from critics .

This will mark Burton's first foray into directing television since the 1980s and he is expected to helm all eight episodes in the first season ,  which began production in September 2021 . After Kevin Smith had been hired to write a new Superman film ,  he suggested Burton to direct . In 2001 ,  The Walt Disney Company began to consider producing a sequel to The Nightmare Before Christmas ,  but rather than using stop motion ,  Disney wanted to use computer animation . In 2012 ,  Shane Acker confirmed that Burton would work with Valve to create his next animated feature film ,  Deep .  Like 9 ,  the film would take place in a post-apocalyptic world (although set in a different universe) .  Deep would be another darker animated film ,  as Shane Acker has expressed his interest in creating more PG-13 animated films . On January 19 ,  2010 ,  it was announced that after Dark Shadows ,  Burton's next project would be Maleficent ,  a Wicked-like film that showed the origin and the past of Sleeping Beauty's antagonist Maleficent .  In an interview with Fandango published February 23 ,  2010 ,  however ,  Burton denied he was directing any upcoming Sleeping Beauty film . It was reported that Burton would direct a 3D stop motion animation adaptation of The Addams Family ,  which was confirmed by Christopher Meledandri , In 2011 ,  it was reported that Burton was working on a live-action adaptation of The Hunchback of Notre-Dame starring Josh Brolin ,  who would also be co-producing .  The project did not move forward .

969,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Mateiu_Caragiale,Mateiu_Caragiale,Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing," A native of Bucharest ,  he was born out of wedlock to Ion Luca Caragiale and Maria Constantinescu ,  an unmarried former Town Hall employeeThe young Caragiale was sent to school at Anghel Demetriescu's Sfântul Gheorghe College in Bucharest ,  where he discovered a passion for history and heraldry . In 1904 ,  his father moved to Berlin ,  bringing Mateiu with him—in hopes that he could be persuaded to study law at the Frederick William University— ,  but Mateiu spent his time reading and exploring the Imperial German capital . The conflict with his father was to prolong itself for as long as the latter was alive . The situation most likely degenerated in 1904 ,  after the death of his aunt Lenci ,  when Ion Luca took over his son's inheritance ,  and aggravated by his father's decision to cease subsidizing him ,  which left the latter without a stable source of income . In spring 1907 ,  despite the ongoing father-son tensions ,  Mateiu ,  who was recovering from a severe form of measles ,  returned to Berlin ,  where Ion Luca's family was still residing . Mateiu Caragiale had his first thoughts on Craii de Curtea-Veche in 1910 . His father died in June 1912 ,  which ,  according to Șerban Cioculescu (who cited Mateiu's correspondence) ,  left him indifferent . Caragiale returned to Bucharest :  in summer 1912 ,  with help from journalist Rudolf Uhrinowsky ,  the young writer was employed by a French-language gazette ,  L'Indépendence Roumaine ,  informing his readers that he had also become the sole legitimate Caragiale family representative in Romania . As Caragiale senior died ,  Mateiu initially planned to join the mainstream Conservative Party and demand a post from Grigore Gheorghe Cantacuzino ,  the Mayor of Bucharest and a close associate of Bogdan-Pitești . He assumed office on November 7 ,  1912 ,  but ,  as he later confessed ,  official records were modified to make it seem that he had been a civil servant since October 29 . During the early stages of World War I ,  as Romania remained a neutral country ,  Caragiale's notes record that his friend Bogdan-Pitești was acting as a political agent of the Central Powers ,  and that money he made available had been provided by German propaganda funds . A frequenter of the renowned restaurant Casa Capșa ,  Mateiu Caragiale was constantly surrounded by a tight group of party-goers ,  which included UhrinowskyAs Romania joined the Allied Powers and the Romanian Campaign began ,  overlooked by conscription into the Romanian Army , In 1919 ,  as Ionescu gained political influence through his alliance with the People's League ,  he became head of the press bureau of the Minister of Internal Affairs ,  serving until 1921 . Also in 1921 ,  a first draft of his Remember saw print in Viața Românească . Mateiu Caragiale published Remember as a volume the following year ; In March 1926-October 1928 ,  Tudor Vianu's Gândirea magazine published his novel Craii de Curtea-Veche as a series . By 1926 ,  he rallied with the People's League ,  and unsuccessfully asked Octavian Goga to assign him a candidature for a Parliamentary seat during the elections of that year . His political projects were put on hold ,  and Caragiale instead concentrated his energy on obtaining the French Légion d'honneur order ,  eventually becoming one of its Chevaliers in December 1929 .  The Romanian author himself noted that this had been made possible by the intercession of François Lebrun ,  the Bucharest correspondent of Le Matin newspaper ,  whom he considered a personal friend . Caragiale also began work on the fragmentary writing Soborul țațelor (""The Council of Busibodies"" ,  1929) and the detective story Sub pecetea tainei (""Under the Seal of Secrecy"" ,  1930) ,  but they would remain unfinished .  In its first draft ,  Sub pecetea tainei was published by Gândirea in April 1930-April 1933 , In 1931 ,  the writer was still hoping for a return to the political stage ,  this time with the Nationalist Democratic Party ,  which came to power under Nicolae Iorga .  To this goal ,  he approached Internal Affairs Undersecretary Nicolae Ottescu ,  requesting appointment as prefect ,  but was refused . He ceased most literary activities later in the year ,  and confessed in his diary :  ""My spiritual state is probably the same as that of people who feel their final hour nearing and lose all hope"" . Mateiu Caragiale died two years later in Bucharest ,  at the age 51 ,  after suffering a stroke .     "

982,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Robert_Crumb,Robert_Crumb,Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing,"   Crumb's father gave him $40 when he left home after high school . Crumb married Dana Morgan in 1964 .   Nearly destitute ,  the couple traveled in Europe ,  during which Crumb continued to produce work for Kurtzman and American Greetings ,  and Dana stole food . In 1965 and 1966 Crumb had a number of Fritz the Cat strips published in the men's magazine Cavalier .   Fritz had appeared in Crumb's work as early as the late 1950s ;  he was to become a hipster ,  scam artist ,  and bohemian until Crumb abandoned the character in 1969 . Crumb was becoming increasingly uncomfortable with his job and marriage when in June 1965 he began taking LSD ,  a psychedelic drug that was then still legal .   He had both good and bad trips .   One bad trip left him in a muddled state for half a year ,  during which for a time he left Dana ;  the state ended when the two took a strong dose of the drug together in April 1966 . In January 1967 Crumb came across two friends in a bar who were about to leave for San Francisco ;  Crumb was interested in the work of San Francisco-based psychedelic poster artists ,  and on a whim asked if he could join them . Independent publisher Don Donahue invited Crumb to make a comic book ;  Crumb drew up two issues of Zap Comix ,  and Donahue published the firstCrumb met cartoonist S .  Clay Wilson ,  an art school graduate who saw himself as a rebel against middle-class American values and whose comics were violent and grotesque .  Wilson's attitude inspired Crumb to give up the idea of the cartoonist-as-entertainer and to focus on comics as open ,  uncensored self-expression ;  in particular ,  his work soon became sexually explicit ,  as in the pornographic Snatch he and Wilson produced late in 1968 . The second issue of Zap appeared in June with contributions from Wilson and poster artists Victor Moscoso and Rick Griffin .  Artist H . Fish also contributed to Zap .  In December ,  Donahue published the still-unreleased issue as #0 and a new third issue with Gilbert Shelton joining the roster of regulars .  Zap was financially successful ,  and developed a market for underground comix . Crumb was a prolific cartoonist in the late 1960s and early 1970s ;  at his peak point of output he produced 320 pages over two years . Crumb's work also appeared in Nasty Tales ,  a 1970s British underground comic .  The publishers were acquitted in a celebrated 1972 obscenity trial at the Old Bailey in London ;  the first such case involving a comic .  Giving evidence at the trial ,  one of the defendants said of Crumb :  ""He is the most outstanding ,  certainly the most interesting ,  artist to appear from the underground ,  and this (Dirty Dog) is Rabelaisian satire of a very high order .  He is using coarseness quite deliberately in order to get across a view of social hypocrisy . ""While meditating in 1980 ,  Crumb conceived of a magazine with a lowbrow aesthetic inspired by punk zines ,  Mad ,  and men's magazines of the 1940s and 1950s . The Crumbs moved into a house in southeastern France in 1991 ,  which is said to have been financed by the sale of six Crumb sketchbooks .  The film won several major critical accolades . From 1987 to 2005 Fantagraphics Books published the seventeen-volume Complete Crumb ComicsIn 2009 ,  after four years of work ,  Crumb produced The Book of Genesis ,  an unabridged illustrated graphic novel version of the biblical Book of Genesis . In January 2015 ,  Crumb was asked to submit a cartoon to the left-wing magazine Libération as a tribute for the Charlie Hebdo shooting .  He sent a drawing titled ""A Cowardly Cartoonist , "" depicting an illustration of the backside of Crumb's friend Mohamid Bakshi ,  while referencing the prophet Muhammad ,  founder of Islam . A friend of comic book writer Harvey Pekar ,  Crumb illustrated over 30 stories of Pekar's in the award-winning comic book series American Splendor ,  primarily in the first eight issues (1976–1983) .  As The Complete Crumb Comics co-editor Robert Fiore wrote about their collaborations :  .  .  .  in American Splendor ,  Crumb's work stood out for .  .  .  the way he really made Pekar's voice SING .  His style embodied Pekar's voice .  .  .  He turned Pekar's scripts into pure comics ,  into something that would have been inferior in any other medium .  .  .  But I think what makes all of their collaborations work so well is the fact that Crumb is as sympathetic a collaborator as Pekar ever had .  It's not just the fact that Crumb draws better than everybody else ,  he knew what to draw .  Just as Pekar knew what to write .  .  .  Their mutual understanding of each other helped me appreciate each as artists and voices .  .  . Crumb collaborates with his wife ,  Aline Kominsky-Crumb ,  on many strips and comics ,  including Dirty Laundry Comics ,  Self-Loathing Comics ,  and work published in The New Yorker . In 1978 ,  Crumb allowed his artwork to be used as pictorial rubber stamp designs by Top Drawer Rubber Stamp Company ,  a collaboration between cartoonist Art Spiegelman ,  publisher Françoise Mouly ,  and people living at Quarry Hill Creative Center in Rochester ,  Vermont .  R .  Crumb's imagery proved to be some of the most popular designs produced by this avant-garde pictorial stamp company . In the 1980s and 1990s ,  Crumb illustrated a number of writer Charles Bukowski stories ,  including the collection The Captain Is Out to Lunch and the Sailors Have Taken Over the Ship and the story ""Bring Me Your Love . ""In 1984–1985 Crumb produced a series of illustrations for the tenth anniversary edition of Edward Abbey's environmental-themed novel The Monkey Wrench Gang ,  published in 1985 by Dream Garden Press of Salt Lake City .  Many of these illustrations also appeared in a 1987 Monkey Wrench Gang calendar ,  and remain available on T-shirts . R .  Crumb Comix ,  a theatrical production based on his work and directed by Johnny Simons ,  was produced in Fort Worth ,  Texas ,  in 1986 .  It was revived at Duke University in 1990 ,  and co-starred Avner Eisenberg .  The development of the play was supervised by Crumb ,  who also served as set designer ,  drawing larger-than-life representations of some of his most famous characters all over the floors and walls of the set . Crumb's collaboration with David Zane Mairowitz ,  the illustrated ,  part-comic biography and bibliography Introducing Kafka (1993) ,  a . k . a .  Kafka for Beginners ,  is one of his less sexual- and satire-oriented ,  comparably highbrow works .  It is well-known and favorably received ,  and due to its popularity was republished as R .  Crumb's Kafka . Crumb has frequently drawn comics about his musical interests in blues ,  country ,  bluegrass ,  cajun ,  French Bal-musette ,  jazz ,  big band and swing music from the 1920s and 1930s ,  and they also heavily influenced the soundtrack choices for his bandmate Zwigoff's 1995 Crumb documentary .   In 2006 ,  he prepared ,  compiled and illustrated the book R .  Crumb's Heroes of Blues ,  Jazz & Country ,  with accompanying CD ,  which derived from three series of trading cards originally published in the 1980s . Crumb was the leader of the band R .  Crumb & His Cheap Suit Serenaders ,  for which he sang lead vocals ,  wrote several songs and played banjo and other instruments .  He also provided the cover art for this and other albums . Crumb has released CDs anthologizing old original performances gleaned from collectible 78-rpm phonograph records .   His That's What I Call Sweet Music was released in 1999 and Hot Women :  Women Singers from the Torrid Regions in 2009 .   Chimpin' the Blues ,  a collaboration with fellow record collector Jerry Zolten that combines rare recordings with conversation about the music and the musicians ,  was released in 2013 .  Crumb drew the cover art for these CDs as well . In 2013 ,  Crumb played mandolin with the Eden and John's East River String Band on their album Take A Look at That Baby and also took part in the accompanying music video . Crumb has illustrated many album covers ,  most prominently Cheap Thrills by Big Brother and the Holding Company and the compilation album The Music Never Stopped :  Roots of the Grateful Dead . Between 1974 and 1984 ,  Crumb drew at least 17 album covers for Yazoo Records/Blue Goose Records ,  including those of the Cheap Suit Serenaders .   He also created the revised logo and record label designs of Blue Goose Records that were used from 1974 onward . In 1992 and 1993 ,  Robert Crumb was involved in a project by Dutch formation The Beau Hunks and provided the cover art for both their albums The Beau Hunks play the original Laurel & Hardy music 1 and 2 .  He also illustrated the albums' booklets . In 2009 ,  Crumb drew the artwork for a 10-CD anthology of French traditional music compiled by Guillaume Veillet for Frémeaux & Associés .  and ,  in 2011 ,  he once again played mandolin on an Eden and John's East River String Band album (Be Kind to a Man When He's Down) for which he also created the album cover artwork .

998,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Elizabeth_Enright,Elizabeth_Enright,Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing,"   Beginning as a magazine illustrator ,  in 1930 Enright illustrated Marian King's Kees ,  a children's book about a Dutch boy and his pet duck .  At one point Enright developed a series of sketches with an African flair .  She then wrote a story to go with them ,  and in 1935 her first book ,  Kintu :  A Congo Adventure was published .  It is significant that reviewers sometimes preferred the story over the pictures ,  as this encouraged Enright to turn more and more to writing .  After 1951 her children's books were illustrated by other artists . Her next book ,  Thimble Summer ,  (1938) ,  blended memories of summers spent on Frank Lloyd Wright's farm in Wisconsin and family stories from her mother and grandmother .  It received the Newbery Medal for 1939 ,  making Enright ,  at thirty ,  one of the youngest writers ever to win the award . Enright's Gone-Away Lake appeared two decades later in 1957 and became a Newbery Honor book .  The first editions of Gone-Away Lake and its 1961 sequel ,  Return to Gone-Away ,  were illustrated by noted illustrators Joe and Beth Krush .  In the early twenty-first century ,  reissued American editions of the Gone-Away books featured cover art by Harry Potter illustrator Mary GrandPre but retained the Krushes' interior illustrations . Enright also wrote the popular Melendy Quartet ,  a series of four children's novels published between 1941 and 1951 :  The Saturdays (novel) ,  The Four-Story Mistake ,  Then There Were Five ,  and Spiderweb for Two :  A Melendy Maze .  This series tells the adventures of four siblings who live in New York City and later in upstate New York with their father ,  an economist ,  and a housekeeper named Cuffy . Tatsinda ,  a traditional fairy tale ,  was named an Honor Book at the 1963 New York Herald Tribune's Children's Spring Book Festival .  Enright's final children's book ,  Zee ,  the story of a naughty fairy ,  appeared in 1966 . Enright's short stories for adult readers were published in magazines such as The New Yorker ,  Ladies Home Journal ,  Cosmopolitan ,  The Yale Review ,  Harper's Magazine (monthly) and The Saturday Evening Post .  They have been reprinted in anthologies ,  including The Best American Short Stories (1951 ,  1952) and O .  Henry Prize Stories (1946 ,  1949 ,  1950 ,  1960) ;  and were collected in Borrowed Summer and Other Stories ,  The Moment Before the Rain ,  and The Riddle of the Fly .  Her final book ,  Doublefields :  Memories and Stories ,  is a combination of short fiction and tales from her own life experiences .   "
999,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Jules_Feiffer,Jules_Feiffer,Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing," Feiffer was born in The Bronx ,  New York City ,  on January 26 ,  1929 .  His parents were David Feiffer and Rhoda (née Davis) ,  and Feiffer was raised in a Jewish household with a younger and an older sister . When he was 13 his mother gave him a drawing table for his bedroom .  She also enrolled him in the Art Students League of New York to study anatomy .  He graduated from James Monroe High School in 1947 .  He wrote in 1965 about his childhood : I came to the field with a more serious intent than my opiate-minded contemporaries .  While they ,  in those pre-super days ,  were eating up ""Cosmo ,  Master of Disguise"" ;  ""Speed Saunders"" ;  and ""Bart Regan Spy"" ,  I was counting up how many panels there were to a page ,  how many pages there were to a story – learning how to form ,  for my own use ,  phrases like :  @X#?/ ;  marking for future reference which comic book hero was swiped from which radio hero :  Buck Marshall from Tom Mix ;  the Crimson Avenger from The Green Hornet .  .  . Feiffer says that cartoons were his first interest when young ,  ""what I loved the most . ""Among his favorite cartoons were Our Boarding House ,  Alley Oop and Wash Tubbs .   After Feiffer graduated from high school at 16 ,  he was desperate for a job ,  and went unannounced to the office of one of his favorite cartoonists ,  Will Eisner .  Eisner was sympathetic to young Feiffer ,  as Eisner had been in a similar situation when he first started out .  He asked Feiffer ,  ""What can you do?"" He answered ,  ""I'll do anything .  I'll do coloring ,  or clean-up ,  or anything ,  and I'd like to work for nothing . ""Eisner considered Feiffer a mediocre artist ,  but he ""liked the kid's spunk and intensity"" ,  writes Eisner biographer Michael Schumacher .  Eisner was also aware that they both came from similar backgrounds ,  despite his being twelve years older .  They both had fathers who struggled to support their family ,  and both their mothers were strong figures who held the family together through hardships .  As Eisner recalled in 1978 : He began working as just a studio man – he would do erasing ,  cleanup .  .  .  Gradually it became very clear that he could write better than he could draw and preferred it ,  indeed – so he wound up doing balloons Our fights were always collegial .  Never once did  pull rank on me .  I was always amazed by what he let me get away with .  It shows how close and tight the relationship was ,  that he let me do that parody .  He had great generosity of soul—Jules FeifferThey collaborated well on The Spirit ,  sharing ideas ,  arguing points ,  and making changes when they agreed .  In 1947 ,  Feiffer also attended the Pratt Institute for a year to improve his art style . After working with Eisner for nearly a decade ,  he chose to start creating his own comic strips .  In 1956 ,  after again first proving his talent by working for free ,  he became a staff cartoonist at The Village Voice where he produced the weekly comic strip titled Feiffer .  Feiffer's strips ran for 42 years ,  until 1997 ,  at first titled Sick Sick Sick ,  then as Feiffer's Fables ,  and finally as simply Feiffer .  After a year with the Voice ,  Feiffer compiled a collection of many of his satire cartoons into a best-selling book ,  Sick Sick Sick :  A Guide to Non-Confident Living (1958) ,  a dissection of popular social and political neuroses .  The success of that collection led to his becoming a regular contributor to the London Observer and Playboy magazine .  After first becoming aware of Feiffer's work ,  Kubrick wrote him in 1958 : The comic themes you weave are very close to my heart .  .  .  I must express unqualified admiration for the scenic structure of your ""strips"" and the eminently speakable and funny dialog .  .  .  I should be most interested in furthering our contact with an eye toward doing a film along the moods and themes you have so brilliantly accomplished . By April 1959 ,  Feiffer was distributed nationally by the Hall Syndicate ,  initially in The Boston Globe ,  Minneapolis Star Tribune ,  Newark Star-Ledger and Long Island Press .  Eventually ,  his strips covered the nation ,  including magazines ,  and were published regularly in major publications such as the Los Angeles Times ,  The New Yorker ,  Esquire ,  Playboy and The Nation .  He was commissioned in 1997 by The New York Times to create its first op-ed page comic strip ,  which ran monthly until 2000 . Feiffer's cartoons were typically mini satires ,  where he portrayed ordinary people's thoughts about subjects such as sex ,  marriage ,  violence and politics .  Writer Larry DuBois describes Feiffer's cartoon style : Feiffer had no stories to tell .  His main concern was to explore character .  In a series of a dozen or so pictures ,  he would show the shifts of mood that flickered across the faces of men and women as they tried ,  often vainly ,  to explain themselves to the world ,  to their husbands and wives ,  to their mistresses and lovers ,  to their employers ,  to their rulers ,  or simply to the unseen adversaries at the other end of the telephone wires .  .  . It would be no exaggeration to say that his dialog is as acute as any that is being written America today .  Dialog aimed at sophisticated minds ,  usually with the purpose of shaking them out of sophistication into real awareness . Feiffer's work is represented by R .  Michelson Galleries ,  located in Northampton ,  Massachusetts . Feiffer published the hit Sick ,  Sick ,  Sick :  A Guide to Non-Confident Living in 1958 (which featured a collection of cartoons from about 1950 to 1956) ,  and followed up with More Sick ,  Sick ,  Sick and other strip collections ,  including The Explainers ,  Boy Girl ,  Boy Girl ,  Hold Me! ,  Feiffer's Album ,  The Unexpurgated Memoirs of Bernard Mergendeiler ,  Feiffer on Nixon ,  Jules Feiffer's America :  From Eisenhower to Reagan ,  Marriage Is an Invasion of Privacy and Feiffer's Children .  Passionella (1957) is a graphic narrative initially anthologized in Passionella and Other Stories ,  a variation on the story of Cinderella .  The protagonist is Ella ,  a chimney sweep who is transformed into a Hollywood movie star .  Passionella was used in a musical ,  The Apple Tree . His cartoons ,  strips and illustrations have been reprinted by Fantagraphics as Feiffer :  The Collected Works .  Explainers (2008) reprints all of his strips from 1956 to 1966 .  David Kamp reviewed the book in The New York Times : His strip ,  usually six to eight borderless panels ,  initially appeared under the title Sick Sick Sick ,  with the subtitle 'A Guide to Non-Confident Living' .  As the Lenny Bruce-ish language suggests ,  the earliest strips are very much of their time ,  the postwar Age of Anxiety in the big city ;  you can practically smell the espresso ,  the unfiltered ciggies ,  the lanolin whiff of woolly jumpers . Feiffer has written two novels (1963's Harry the Rat with Women ,  1977's Ackroyd) and several children's books ,  including Bark ,  George ;  Henry ,  The Dog with No Tail ;  A Room with a Zoo ;  The Daddy Mountain and A Barrel of Laughs ,  a Vale of Tears .  He partnered with The Walt Disney Company and writer Andrew Lippa to adapt his book The Man in the Ceiling into a musical .  He illustrated the children's books The Phantom Tollbooth and The Odious Ogre .  His non-fiction includes the 1965 book The Great Comic Book Heroes . I want to write about marriage .  I think the most interesting story is how men and women get on with each other ,  the terms they accept to live together and survive together ,  the compromises they make ,  the betrayals of themselves and of each other ,  and how ,  despite the fact that over and over again they find that it can't possibly work ,  it still seems to be preferable to anything else they know about .  In the end ,  it becomes rather heroic . —Jules Feiffer ,  Playboy interviewFeiffer also wrote and drew one of the earliest graphic novels ,  the hardcover Tantrum (Alfred A .  Knopf ,  1979) ,  described on its dustjacket as a ""novel-in-pictures"" .  Like the trade paperback The Silver Surfer (Simon & Schuster/Fireside Books ,  August 1978) ,  by Marvel Comics' Stan Lee and Jack Kirby ,  and the hardcover and trade paperback versions of Will Eisner's A Contract with God ,  and Other Tenement Stories (Baronet Books ,  October 1978) ,  this was published by a traditional book publisher and distributed through bookstores ,  whereas other early graphic novels ,  such as Sabre (Eclipse Books ,  August 1978) ,  were distributed through some of the first comic-book stores . His autobiography ,  Backing into Forward :  A Memoir (Doubleday ,  2010) ,  received positive reviews from The New York Times and Publishers Weekly ,  which wrote : His account of hitchhiking cross-country invades Kerouac territory ,  while his ink-stained memories of the comics industry rival Michael Chabon's Pulitzer Prize–winning fictional portrait .  Two years in the military gave Feiffer fodder for the trenchant Munro (about a child who is drafted) .  Such satirical social and political commentary became the turning point in his lust for fame ,  which finally happened ,  after many rejections ,  when acclaim for his anxiety-ridden Village Voice strips served as a springboard into other projects . He has had retrospectives at the New York Historical Society ,  the Library of Congress and The School of Visual Arts .  His artwork is exhibited at and represented by Chicago's Jean Albano Gallery . In 2014 ,  Feiffer published Kill My Mother :  A Graphic Novel through Liveright Publishing .  Kill My Mother was named a Vanity Fair Best Book of 2014 and a Kirkus Reviews Best Fiction Book of 2014 .  In 2016 ,  Feiffer published Cousin Joseph :  A Graphic Novel ,  a prequel to Kill My Mother .  Cousin Joseph was also published through Liveright Publishing ,  and was a New York Times Bestseller ,  named one of The Washington Post's Best Graphic Novels of the Year ,  and was nominated for the Lynd Ward Graphic Novel Prize . Feiffer's picture book for young readers ,  Rupert Can Dance ,  was published by FSG in 2014 . Feiffer's plays include Little Murders (1967) ,  Feiffer's People (1969) ,  Knock Knock (1976) ,  Elliot Loves (1990) ,  The White House Murder Case ,  and Grown Ups .  After Mike Nichols adapted Feiffer's unproduced play Carnal Knowledge as a 1971 film ,  Feiffer scripted Robert Altman's Popeye ,  Alain Resnais's I Want to Go Home ,  and the film adaptation of Little Murders . The original production of Hold Me! was directed by Caymichael Patten and opened at The American Place Theatre ,  Subplot Cafe ,  as part of its American Humorist Series on January 13 ,  1977 .  The production ran on the Showtime cable network in 1981 . Feiffer moved to Shelter Island ,  New York in 2017 . Feiffer is an adjunct professor at Stony Brook Southampton .  Previously he taught at the Yale School of Drama and Northwestern University .  He has been a Senior Fellow at the Columbia University National Arts Journalism Program .  He was in residence at the Arizona State University Barrett Honors College from November 27 to December 2 ,  2006 .  In June–August 2009 ,  Feiffer was in residence as a Montgomery Fellow at Dartmouth College ,  where he taught an undergraduate course on graphic humor in the 20th century .   "
1000,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Louise_Fitzhugh,Louise_Fitzhugh,Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing," Fitzhugh was born in Memphis ,  Tennessee ,  to wealthy parents in 1928 .  Her parents divorced when she was an infant and her father ,  Millsaps Fitzhugh ,  gained custody ;  she lived with him in the South .  She attended Miss Hutchison's School and three different universities .  She lived in Washington ,  D . C .  ,  France ,  and Italy . She attended Bard College where she became involved in politics and anti-racism .  She studied art in Italy and France ,  and continued her studies at the Art Students League and the Cooper Union .   She lived most of her adult life in New York City and had houses in both Long Island and Bridgewater ,  Connecticut . Fitzhugh was the illustrator of the 1961 children's book Suzuki Beane ,  a parody of Eloise ;  while Eloise lived in the Plaza ,  Suzuki was the daughter of beatnik parents and slept on a mattress on the floor of a Bleecker Street pad in Greenwich Village .  Fitzhugh worked closely with author Sandra Scoppettone to produce Suzuki Beane ,  which incorporated typewriter font and line drawings in an original way .  Although a parody of both Eloise and beatnik conceit ,  the book sprang to life as a genuine work of literature .  Today ,  it is much sought after on used-book websites . Fitzhugh's best-known book was Harriet the Spy ,  published in 1964 to some controversy since so many characters were far from admirable .  It has since become a classic .  According to her New York Times obituary ,  published November 19 ,  1974 :  ""The book helped introduce a new realism to children's fiction and has been widely imitated"" .  Harriet is the daughter of affluent New Yorkers who leave her in the care of her nanny ,  Ole Golly ,  in their Manhattan townhouse .  Hardly the feminine girl heroine typical of the early 1960s ,  Harriet is a writer who notes everything about everybody in her world in a notebook which ultimately falls into the wrong hands .  Ole Golly gives Harriet the unlikely but practical advice that :  ""Sometimes you have to lie .  But to yourself you must always tell the truth"" .  By and large ,  Harriet the Spy was well-received—it was named to the New York Times Outstanding Book Award list in 1964—and it has sold 4 million copies since publication .  It was very popular among young girls ,  particularly non-conforming girls who lacked representation in fiction . Fitzhugh ,  like many of Harriet's fans ,  was a lesbian .  ""Although Harriet's sexuality is never touched on in the book ,  her boy's clothes and bravado sent a message to some kids who felt different and didn't know why . ""Two characters from the book ,  Beth Ellen and Sport ,  were featured in two of Fitzhugh's later books ,  The Long Secret and Sport .  The Long Secret deals fairly honestly with female puberty ;  the main characters are pre-teen girls who discuss how their changing bodies feel . Another young adult manuscript ,  Amelia ,  concerned two girls falling in love .  This manuscript was not published and was later lost . Fitzhugh illustrated many of her books and had works exhibited in Banfer Gallery ,  New York ,  in 1963 ,  among many other galleries . Her 1974 novel Nobody's Family is Going to Change was adapted into the 1983 Tony-nominated musical The Tap Dance Kid . Fitzhugh died in 1974 of a brain aneurysm ,  eight days before the publication of Nobody's Family Is Going To Change .  Her obituary was published in The New York Times .

1008,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/W._S._Gilbert,W._S._Gilbert,Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing,"  (Gilbert claimed this incident was autobiographical . )Gilbert was born at 17 Southampton Street ,  Strand ,  London .  His father ,  also named William ,  was briefly a naval surgeon ,  who later became a writer of novels and short stories ,  some of which his son illustrated .  Gilbert's mother was the former Anne Mary Bye Morris (1812–1888) ,  the daughter of Thomas Morris ,  an apothecary . As a child ,  Gilbert travelled to Italy in 1838 and then France for two years with his parents ,  who finally returned to settle in London in 1847 .  He was educated at Boulogne ,  France ,  from the age of seven (he later kept his diary in French so that the servants could not read it) , To supplement his income from 1861 on ,  Gilbert wrote a variety of stories ,  comic rants ,  grotesque illustrations ,  theatre reviews (many in the form of a parody of the play being reviewed) , The poems ,  illustrated humorously by Gilbert ,  proved immensely popular and were reprinted in book form as the Bab Ballads . After a relationship in the mid-1860s with the novelist Annie Thomas , Gilbert wrote and directed several plays at school ,  but his first professionally produced play was Uncle Baby ,  which ran for seven weeks in the autumn of 1863 . In 1865–66 ,  Gilbert collaborated with Charles Millward on several pantomimes ,  including one called Hush-a-Bye ,  Baby ,  On the Tree Top ,  or ,  Harlequin Fortunia ,  King Frog of Frog Island ,  and the Magic Toys of Lowther Arcade (1866) .  For instance : That men were monkeys once – to that I bow ; (looking at Lord Margate) I know one who's less man than monkey ,  now ; That monkeys once were men ,  peers ,  statesmen ,  flunkies –That's rather hard on unoffending monkeys!This was followed by Gilbert's penultimate operatic parody ,  Robert the Devil ,  a burlesque of Giacomo Meyerbeer's opera ,  Robert le diable ,  which was part of a triple bill that opened the Gaiety Theatre ,  London ,  in 1868 .  The piece was Gilbert's biggest success to date ,  running for over 100 nights and being frequently revived and played continuously in the provinces for three years thereafter . In Victorian theatre ,  ""Theatre ,  at the time Gilbert began writing ,  had fallen into disrepute .  Badly translated and adapted French operettas and poorly written ,  prurient Victorian burlesques dominated the London stage .  As Jessie Bond vividly described it ,  ""stilted tragedy and vulgar farce were all the would-be playgoer had to choose from ,  and the theatre had become a place of evil repute to the righteous British householder . ""From 1869 to 1875 ,  Gilbert joined with one of the leading figures in theatrical reform ,  Thomas German Reed (and his wife Priscilla) ,  whose Gallery of Illustration sought to regain some of theatre's lost respectability by offering family entertainments in London . The environment of the German Reeds' intimate theatre allowed Gilbert quickly to develop a personal style and freedom to control all aspects of production ,  including set ,  costumes ,  direction and stage management .  The Bab Ballads and Gilbert's many early musical works gave him much practice as a lyricist even before his collaboration with Sullivan . Many of the plot elements of the German Reed Entertainments (as well as some from his earlier plays and Bab Ballads) would be reused by Gilbert later in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas .  These elements include paintings coming to life (Ages Ago ,  used again in Ruddigore) ,  a deaf nursemaid binding a respectable man's son to a ""pirate"" instead of to a ""pilot"" by mistake (Our Island Home ,  1870 ,  reused in The Pirates of Penzance) ,  and the forceful mature lady who is ""an acquired taste"" (Eyes and No Eyes ,  1875 ,  reused in The Mikado) . At the same time ,  Gilbert created several ""fairy comedies"" at the Haymarket Theatre .  This series of plays was founded upon the idea of self-revelation by characters under the influence of some magic or some supernatural interference . During this period ,  Gilbert also pushed the boundaries of how far satire could go in the theatre .  He collaborated with Gilbert Arthur à Beckett on The Happy Land (1873) ,  a political satire (in part ,  a parody of his own The Wicked World) ,  which was briefly banned because of its unflattering caricatures of Gladstone and his ministers . Once he became established ,  Gilbert was the stage director for his plays and operas and had strong opinions on how they should best be performed . In Gilbert's 1874 burlesque ,  Rosencrantz and Guildenstern ,  the character Hamlet ,  in his speech to the players ,  sums up Gilbert's theory of comic acting :  ""I hold that there is no such antick fellow as your bombastical hero who doth so earnestly spout forth his folly as to make his hearers believe that he is unconscious of all incongruity"" . Gilbert prepared meticulously for each new work ,  making models of the stage ,  actors and set pieces ,  and designing every action and bit of business in advance .    "

1010,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Edward_Gorey,Edward_Gorey,Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing," Edward St .  John Gorey was born in Chicago .  His parents ,  Helen Dunham (née Garvey) and Edward Leo Gorey ,  divorced in 1936 when he was 11 ,  then remarried in 1952 when he was 27 .  His stepmother was Corinna Mura (1910–1965) ,  a cabaret singer who had a small role in Casablanca as the woman playing the guitar while singing ""La Marseillaise"" at Rick's Café Américain .  His father was briefly a journalist .  Gorey's maternal great-grandmother ,  Helen St .  John Garvey ,  was a nineteenth-century greeting card illustrator ,  from whom he claimed to have inherited his talents . From 1934 to 1937 ,  Gorey attended public schools in the Chicago suburb of Wilmette ,  Illinois ,  where his classmates included Charlton Heston ,  Warren MacKenzie ,  and Joan Mitchell . In the early 1950s ,  Gorey ,  with a group of recent Harvard alumni including Alison Lurie (1947) ,  John Ashbery (1949) ,  Donald Hall (1951) and O'Hara (1950) ,  amongst others ,  founded the Poets' Theatre in Cambridge ,  which was supported by Harvard faculty members John Ciardi and Thornton Wilder . He frequently stated that his formal art training was ""negligible"" ;  Gorey studied art for one semester at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1943 .   From 1953 to 1960 ,  he lived in Manhattan and worked for the Art Department of Doubleday Anchor ,  illustrating book covers and in some cases ,  adding illustrations to the text .  In later years he produced cover illustrations and interior artwork for many children's books by John Bellairs ,  as well as books begun by Bellairs and continued by Brad Strickland after Bellairs' death . His first independent work ,  The Unstrung Harp ,  was published in 1953 .  He also published under various pen names ,  some of which were anagrams of his first and last names ,  such as Ogdred Weary ,  Dogear Wryde ,  Ms .  Regera Dowdy ,  and dozens more .  His books also feature the names Eduard Blutig (""Edward Gory"") ,  a German-language pun on his own name ,  and O .  Müde (German for O .  Weary) . At the prompting of Harry Stanton ,  an editor and vice president Addison-Wesley ,  Gorey collaborated on a number of works ,  and continued a lifelong correspondence with Peter F .  Neumeyer . The New York Times credits bookstore owner Andreas Brown and his store ,  the Gotham Book Mart ,  with launching Gorey's career :  ""it became the central clearing house for Mr .  Gorey ,  presenting exhibitions of his work in the store's gallery and eventually turning him into an international celebrity . ""Gorey's illustrated (and sometimes wordless) books ,  with their vaguely ominous air and ostensibly Victorian and Edwardian settings ,  have long had a cult following .  In 1980 ,  Gorey became particularly well known for his animated introduction to the PBS series Mystery! In the introduction of each Mystery! episode ,  host Vincent Price would welcome viewers to ""Gorey Mansion"" . Because of the settings and style of Gorey's work ,  many people have assumed he was British ;  in fact ,  he only left the U . S .  once ,  for a visit to the Scottish Hebrides .  In later years ,  he lived year-round in Yarmouth Port ,  Massachusetts ,  on Cape Cod ,  where he wrote and directed numerous evening-length entertainments ,  often featuring his own papier-mâché puppets ,  an ensemble known as Le Theatricule Stoique .  The first of these productions ,  Lost Shoelaces ,  premiered in Woods Hole ,  Massachusetts on August 13 ,  1987 .  The last was The White Canoe :  an Opera Seria for Hand Puppets ,  for which Gorey wrote the libretto ,  with a score by the composer Daniel James Wolf .  Based on Thomas Moore's poem The Lake of the Dismal Swamp ,  the opera was staged after Gorey's death and directed by his friend ,  neighbor ,  and longtime collaborator Carol Verburg ,  with a puppet stage made by his friends and neighbors ,  the noted set designers Herbert Senn and Helen Pond .  In the early 1970s ,  Gorey wrote an unproduced screenplay for a silent film ,  The Black Doll . After Gorey's death ,  one of his executors ,  Andreas Brown ,  turned up a large cache of unpublished work complete and incomplete .  Brown described the find as ""ample material for many future books and for plays based on his work"" .   "

1021,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Wally_Herbert,Wally_Herbert,Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing,"  Walter Herbert was born into an army family in England who emigrated to Egypt on assignment when he was three .  They moved on to South Africa for nine years .  He studied at the Royal School of Military Survey ,  then spent 18 months surveying in Egypt and Cyprus .  He travelled back to England through Turkey and Greece ,  drawing portraits for his board and lodging . In 1955 ,  when Herbert was 21 ,  he carried out surveying in the Antarctic with the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey ,  during which he became an expert in dog sleighing .  On a journey along the Antarctic Peninsula from Hope Bay to Portal Point ,  he sledged some 5 , 000km (3000 miles) .  This experience with dogs led him to a job with the New Zealand Antarctic programme ,  which commissioned him to purchase dogs in Greenland for the Antarctic .  There he learnt Inuit methods of dog driving . As leader of an exploration party in the early 1960s ,  Herbert surveyed a large area of the Queen Maud range and followed Shackleton (1908) and Scott's (1911) route up the Beardmore Glacier .  Denied a request to proceed to the South Pole ,  his party ascended Mount Nansen and descended a route taken by Amundsen in 1911 ,  thus being the first to retrace these explorers' traverses .  In 1964 he trekked the routes taken by Sverdrup and Cook from Greenland to Ellesmere Island in the Arctic .    "

1026,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Victor_Hugo,Victor_Hugo,Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing," Victor-Marie Hugo was born on 26 February 1802 in Besançon in Eastern France .  The youngest son of Joseph Léopold Sigisbert Hugo (1774–1828) a general in the Napoleonic army ,  and Sophie Trébuchet (1772–1821) ;  the couple had two more sons :  Abel Joseph (1798–1855) and Eugène (1800–1837) .  The Hugo family came from Nancy in Lorraine where Victor Hugo's grandfather was a wood merchant .  Léopold enlisted in the army of Revolutionary France at fourteen ,  he was an atheist and an ardent supporter of the republic created following the abolition of the monarchy in 1792 .  Victor's mother Sophie was a devout Catholic who remained loyal to the deposed dynasty .  They met in Châteaubriant ,  a few miles from Nantes in 1796 and married the following year . Since Hugo's father was an officer in Napoleon's army ,  the family moved frequently from posting to posting ,  Sophie had three children in four years .  Léopold Hugo wrote to his son that he had been conceived on one of the highest peaks in the Vosges Mountains ,  on a journey from Lunéville to Besançon .  ""This elevated origin"" ,  he went on ,  ""seems to have had effects on you so that your muse is now continually sublime . ""In 1810 Hugo's father was created Count Hugo de Cogolludo y Sigüenza by then King of Spain Joseph Bonaparte , Weary of the constant moving required by military life ,  Sophie separated temporarily from Léopold and settled in Paris in 1803 with her sons ;  she began seeing General Victor Fanneau de La Horie ,  Hugo's godfather who had been a comrade of General Hugo's during the campaign in Vendee .  In October 1807 the family rejoined Leopold ,  now Colonel Hugo ,  Governor of the province of Avellino .  In that city ,  Victor was taught math by Giuseppe de Samuele Cagnazzi ,  elder brother of Italian scientist Luca de Samuele Cagnazzi . Sophie Trébuchet ,  mother of Victor HugoGeneral Joseph-Leopold Hugo ,  father of Victor HugoSoon Hugo's father was called to Spain to fight the Peninsular War .  Madame Hugo and her children were sent back to Paris in 1808 ,  where they moved to an old convent ,  12 Impasse des Feuillantines ,  an isolated mansion in a deserted quarter of the left bank of the Seine .  Hiding in a chapel at the back of the garden ,  was Victor Fanneau de La Horie ,  who had conspired to restore the Bourbons and had been condemned to death a few years earlier .  He became a mentor to Victor and his brothers . In 1811 the family joined their father in Spain ,  Victor and his brothers were sent to school in Madrid at the Real Colegio de San Antonio de Abad while Sophie returned to Paris on her own ,  now officially separated from her husband .  In 1812 Victor Fanneau de La Horie was arrested and executed .  In February 1815 Victor and Eugene were taken away from their mother and placed by their father in the Pension Cordier ,  a private boarding school in Paris ,  where Victor and Eugène remained three years while also attending lectures at Lycée Louis le Grand . On 10 July 1816 ,  Hugo wrote in his diary :  “I shall be Chateaubriand or nothing” .  In 1817 he wrote a poem for a competition organised by the Academie Française ,  for which he received an honorable mention .  The Academicians refused to believe that he was only fifteen .   Hugo published his first novel the year following his marriage (Han d'Islande ,  1823) ,  and his second three years later (Bug-Jargal ,  1826) .  Between 1829 and 1840 ,  he published five more volumes of poetry (Les Orientales ,  1829 ;  Les Feuilles d'automne ,  1831 ;  Les Chants du crépuscule ,  1835 ;  Les Voix intérieures ,  1837 ;  and Les Rayons et les Ombres ,  1840) ,  cementing his reputation as one of the greatest elegiac and lyric poets of his time . Like many young writers of his generation ,  Hugo was profoundly influenced by François-René de Chateaubriand ,  the famous figure in the literary movement of Romanticism and France's pre-eminent literary figure during the early 19th century .  In his youth ,  Hugo resolved to be ""Chateaubriand or nothing"" ,  and his life would come to parallel that of his predecessor in many ways .  Like Chateaubriand ,  Hugo furthered the cause of Romanticism ,  became involved in politics (though mostly as a champion of Republicanism) ,  and was forced into exile due to his political stances . The precocious passion and eloquence of Hugo's early work brought success and fame at an early age .  His first collection of poetry (Odes et poésies diverses) was published in 1822 when he was only 20 years old and earned him a royal pension from Louis XVIII .  Though the poems were admired for their spontaneous fervor and fluency ,  the collection that followed four years later in 1826 (Odes et Ballades) revealed Hugo to be a great poet ,  a natural master of lyric and creative song . Victor Hugo's first mature work of fiction was first published in February 1829 by Charles Gosselin without the author's name and reflected the acute social conscience that would infuse his later work .  Le Dernier jour d'un condamné (The Last Day of a Condemned Man) would have a profound influence on later writers such as Albert Camus ,  Charles Dickens ,  and Fyodor Dostoyevsky .  Claude Gueux ,  a documentary short story about a real-life murderer who had been executed in France ,  appeared in 1834 and was later considered by Hugo himself to be a precursor to his great work on social injustice ,  Les Misérables . Hugo became the figurehead of the Romantic literary movement with the plays Cromwell (1827) and Hernani (1830) . Hugo's novel Notre-Dame de Paris (The Hunchback of Notre-Dame) was published in 1831 and quickly translated into other languages across Europe .  One of the effects of the novel was to shame the City of Paris into restoring the much-neglected Cathedral of Notre Dame ,  which was attracting thousands of tourists who had read the popular novel .  The book also inspired a renewed appreciation for pre-Renaissance buildings ,  which thereafter began to be actively preserved . Hugo began planning a major novel about social misery and injustice as early as the 1830s ,  but a full 17 years were needed for Les Misérables to be realised and finally published in 1862 . Hugo had used the departure of prisoners for the Bagne of Toulon in one of his early stories ,  ""Le Dernier Jour d'un condamné"" He went to Toulon to visit the Bagne in 1839 and took extensive notes ,  though he did not start writing the book until 1845 .  On one of the pages of his notes about the prison ,  he wrote in large block letters a possible name for his hero :  "" JEAN TRÉJEAN"" .  When the book was finally written ,  Tréjean became Jean Valjean . Hugo was acutely aware of the quality of the novel ,  as evidenced in a letter he wrote to his publisher ,  Albert Lacroix ,  on 23 March 1862 ,  ""My conviction is that this book is going to be one of the peaks ,  if not the crowning point of my work . "" Publication of Les Misérables went to the highest bidder .  The Belgian publishing house Lacroix and Verboeckhoven undertook a marketing campaign unusual for the time ,  issuing press releases about the work a full six months before the launch .  It also initially published only the first part of the novel (""Fantine"") ,  which was launched simultaneously in major cities .  Installments of the book sold out within hours and had enormous impact on French society . The critical establishment was generally hostile to the novel ;  Taine found it insincere ,  Barbey d'Aurevilly complained of its vulgarity ,  Gustave Flaubert found within it ""neither truth nor greatness"" ,  the Goncourt brothers lambasted its artificiality ,  and Baudelaire – despite giving favourable reviews in newspapers – castigated it in private as ""repulsive and inept"" .  Les Misérables proved popular enough with the masses that the issues it highlighted were soon on the agenda of the National Assembly of France .  Today ,  the novel remains his most well-known work .  It is popular worldwide and has been adapted for cinema ,  television ,  and stage shows . An apocryphal taleThe word used in Guernsey to refer to squid (pieuvre ,  also sometimes applied to octopus) was to enter the French language as a result of its use in the book .  Hugo returned to political and social issues in his next novel ,  L'Homme Qui Rit (The Man Who Laughs) ,  which was published in 1869 and painted a critical picture of the aristocracy .  The novel was not as successful as his previous efforts ,  and Hugo himself began to comment on the growing distance between himself and literary contemporaries such as Flaubert and Émile Zola ,  whose realist and naturalist novels were now exceeding the popularity of his own work . His last novel ,  Quatre-vingt-treize (Ninety-Three) ,  published in 1874 ,  dealt with a subject that Hugo had previously avoided :  the Reign of Terror during the French Revolution .  Though Hugo's popularity was on the decline at the time of its publication ,  many now consider Ninety-Three to be a work on par with Hugo's better-known novels .   "
1027,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Tove_Jansson,Tove_Jansson,Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing," Tove Jansson was born in Helsinki ,  in the Grand Duchy of Finland ,  a part of the Russian Empire at the time .  Her family ,  part of the Swedish-speaking minority of Finland ,  was an artistic one :  her father ,  Viktor Jansson ,  was a sculptor ,  and her mother ,  Signe Hammarsten-Jansson ,  was a Swedish-born graphic designer and illustrator .  Tove's siblings also became artists :  Per Olov Jansson became a photographer and Lars Jansson an author and cartoonist .  Whilst their home was in Helsinki ,  the family spent many of their summers in a rented cottage on an island near Porvoo ,  50km (31 miles) east of Helsinki ; Jansson went to Läroverket för gossar och flickor in Helsinki and then studied at University College of Arts ,  Crafts and Design ,  in Stockholm in 1930–1933 ,  the Graphic School of the Finnish Academy of Fine Arts in 1933–1937 ,  and finally at L'École d'Adrien Holy and L'École des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1938 .  She displayed a number of artworks in exhibitions during the 1930s and early 1940s ,  and her first solo exhibition was held in 1943 . At age 14 ,  Jansson wrote and illustrated her first picture book Sara och Pelle och näckens bläckfiskar (Sara and Pelle and Neptune's Children) . During the 1930s Jansson made several trips to other European countries .  She drew from these for her short stories and articles ,  which she also illustrated ,  and which were also published in magazines ,  periodicals and daily papers .  During this period ,  Jansson also designed many book covers ,  adverts and postcards .  Following her mother's example ,  she drew illustrations for GarmShe was briefly engaged in the 1940s to Atos Wirtanen .  The two women collaborated on many works and projects ,  including a model of the Moominhouse ,  in collaboration with Pentti Eistola .  This is now exhibited at the Moomin museum in Tampere .     "

1029,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/David_Jones_(artist-poet),David_Jones_(artist-poet),Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing," Jones was born at Arabin Road ,  Brockley ,  Kent ,  now a suburb of South East London ,  and later lived in nearby Howson Road .  His father ,  James Jones ,  was born in Flintshire in north Wales ,  to a Welsh-speaking family ,  but he was discouraged from speaking Welsh by his father ,  who believed that habitual use of the language might hold his child back in a career .  James Jones moved to London to work as a printer's overseer for the Christian Herald Press .  He met and married Alice Bradshaw ,  a Londoner ,  and they had three children :  Harold ,  who died at 21 of tuberculosis ,  Alice ,  and David . Jones exhibited artistic promise at an early age ,  even entering drawings for exhibitions of children's artwork .  He wrote that he knew from the age of six he would devote his life to art .  He did not read fluently until the age of eight .  By nine years of age ,  he identified with his father's Welsh background and dropped his Anglo-Saxon first name Walter .  In 1909 ,  at 14 ,  he entered Camberwell Art School ,  where he studied under A .  S .  Hartrick ,  who had worked with Van Gogh and Gauguin and introduced him to the work of the Impressionists and Pre-Raphaelites .  In addition ,  Jones studied literature ,  the subject of a mandatory one-hour weekly class at Camberwell . With the outbreak of the First World War ,  Jones enlisted in the London Welsh Battalion of the Royal Welch Fusiliers on 2 January 1915 and served on the Western Front in 1915–1918 with the 38th (Welsh) Division .  Jones's wartime experience was the basis for his long poem In Parenthesis . In 1919 Jones won a government grant to return at Camberwell Art School .  In 1923 Jones worked as an illustrator ,  for The Game published by Gill and Hilary Pepler .  He also engraved original work for Pepler's St .  Dominic's Press ,  including The Rosary Book .  When Gill moved to Capel-y-ffin in the Black Mountains of South Wales in 1923 ,  Jones returned to London ,  but often visited Gill there and also the Benedictines on Caldey Island ,  near Tenby .   Jones was among the first modern engravers to combine white-line and black-line engraving .  In 1930 eye-strain forced him to give up engraving . In 1924 Jones had become engaged to marry Gill's daughter Petra ,  but in 1927 she broke off the engagement to marry a mutual friend .  Distressed ,  Jones concentrated on art .  Petra's long neck and high forehead continued as female features in his artwork .  Disappointed by published accounts of personal combat experience during the war ,  in 1928 he began writing In Parenthesis ,  a fictional work based on his own experiences in the trenches .  He was now in love with Prudence Pelham ,  who was its muse . From 1929 through the mid-1930s ,  Jones took part in weekly meetings at the Chelsea house of his friend Thomas Ferrier Burns of what has been called the Chelsea Group .  It included the cultural historian Christopher Dawson ,  the philosopher E .  I .  Watkin ,  the type-designer Stanley Morison ,  Harman Grisewood ,  Bernard Wall ,  Eric Gill ,  Martin D'Arcy and others .  They discussed a wide range of topics in relation to Catholic Christianity and sought a religious-cultural counterpart to the Unified Field Theory sought by Einstein .  To these discussions ,  Jones contributed his psychological theory of culture ,  focusing on the balance of utility (efficiency) and gratuity (beauty ,  truth ,  goodness) required for healthy civilization .  The Chelsea Group would be the matrix of The Anathemata ,  The Tablet ,  edited by Tom Burns ,  and the Third Programme ,  the BBC radio programe developed and produced by Grisewood . Jones had long suffered from shell-shock ,  now known as post-traumatic stress disorder .  It contributed to a nervous breakdown in mid-October 1932 ,  precipitated by four months of prolific painting and writing ,  involving 60 large paintings and the first continuous draft of In Parenthesis .  His friends arranged for him to take a therapeutic trip to Jerusalem ,  which did not alleviate his condition ,  but influenced his later poetry .  His breakdown precluded painting for most of the next 16 years .  He was able to work at revising In Parenthesis .  As he revised ,  he read it aloud to close friends ,  including Jim Ede ,  who alerted Richard de la Mare at Faber and Faber ,  to whom Jones agreed to submit it when complete .  In 1937 it was published to very positive reviews and in 1938 won the Hawthornden Prize ,  then the one major British literary award . Though Jones was unable to paint ,  his visual works were shown in Chicago in 1933 ,  at the Venice Biennale in 1934 ,  and at the World's Fair ,  New York ,  in 1939 .  In 1944 an exhibition of his art work toured Britain . Jones spent most of the Second World War in London ,  enduring the Blitz .  He painted a few important pictures ,  and to celebrate the wedding of his friend Harman Grisewood to Margaret Bailey ,  wrote Prothalamion and Epithalamion ,  which were eventually published posthumously . In 1947 Jones created in a single week ten land-and-skyscapes at Helen Sutherland's house in Cumberland .  As in 1932 ,  this burst of activity precipitated a nervous collapse .  He underwent psychotherapy at Bowen House in Harrow ,  under the psychologist William ('Bill') Stevenson .  Influenced by Freud ,  Stevenson traced Jones's breakdown to oedipal and sibling tensions ,  combined with repressed fear during the war ,  explaining that if allowed to strengthen ,  repression in the sexual domain shifted to repression of artistic freedom .  He advised Jones to paint and write as essential to his healing .  This led Jones throughout the 1950s to make many beautiful painted inscriptions (an art form he invented) ,  along with sometimes numinous still-lifes of flowers in glass chalices .  He was able to publish in 1952 his second epic-length poem The Anathemata . In 1954 an Arts Council tour of his work visited Aberystwyth ,  Cardiff ,  Swansea ,  Edinburgh and the Tate Gallery in London . In 1960 ,  Stevenson began prescribing barbiturates and other harmful drugs that sent Jones's creative life into virtual hibernation for the next 12 years ,  though he struggled to revise and shape mid-length poems for inclusion in The Sleeping Lord (1974) ,  a project he managed to complete after the prescriptions were rescinded in the summer of 1972 . In 1970 Jones broke the ball of his femur in a fall and thereafter lived in a room at Calvary Nursing Home in Harrow ,  where he was regularly visited by friends and died in his sleep on 27–28 October 1974 .  He was buried in Ladywell and Brockley Cemetery .  In 1985 ,  he was among 16 Great War poets commemorated on a slate stone unveiled at Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey .

Joyce is currently working on a series of novels and picture books ,  The Guardians of Childhood ,  consisting of a total of 13 books . Joyce has received three Emmys for Rolie Polie Olie ,  a Canada-animated series based on his series of children's books that aired on Disney Channel .  His second television series ,  George Shrinks ,  used to air daily on PBS stations . Joyce created conceptual characters for Disney/Pixar's feature films Toy Story (1995) and A Bug's Life (1998) . In 2001 ,  after Joyce and Ice Age director Chris Wedge failed to adapt one of Joyce's books to the screen ,  Santa Calls ,  they both came up with the idea for the computer-animated film Robots (2005) .

1033,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Rupi_Kaur,Rupi_Kaur,Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing," Kaur was born into a Sikh family in Punjab ,  India ,  on 5 October 1992 . When her father lived in Japan he'd write poetry to Kaur's mother ,  who practiced painting . She performed kirtan and Indian classical music for several years and hoped to be a fashion designer – although her father refused her to pursue it in education . An initial aversion to English meant Kaur was effectively mute for a period of time . She studied rhetoric and professional writing at the University of Waterloo ;  she'd teach creative-writing classes for high school and college students while in education herself .   Kaur first began performing poetry in 2009 . Throughout high school ,  Kaur shared her writing anonymously . Following failed submissions to literary anthologies ,  magazines and journals ,  Kaur's first book ,  Milk and Honey ,  was self-published on Createspace on 4 November 2014 ,  after she begun work at age 18 . In March 2015 ,  as a part of her university photography project ,  Kaur – intending to challenge prevalent societal menstrual taboos and the objectification of women – posted a series of photographs to Instagram depicting herself with menstrual blood stains on her clothing and bed sheets . Her response went viral ,  credited with bringing Kaur more followers and leading to the subsequent rise in popularity of her poetry . As Kaur rose to prominence on social media ,  Milk and Honey was re-released by Andrews McMeel Publishing ,  which saw her work alongside an editor for the first time . At age 22 ,  she employed seven people to aid her ,  as a part of a company she founded . they convinced mei only had a few good years leftbefore i was replaced by a girl younger than meas though men yield power with agebut women grow into irrelevancethey can keep their liesfor i have just gotten startedi feel as though i just left the wombmy twenties are the warm-upfor what i'm really about to dowait till you see me in my thirtiesnow that will be a proper introductionto the nasty ,  wild ,  woman in me , how can i leave before the party's startedrehearsals begin at fortyi ripen with agei do not come with an expiration dateand nowfor the main eventcurtains up at fiftylet's begin the showTimelessFollowing a three-month writing trip in California ,  and in the same year as her induction into the Brampton Arts Walk of Fame ,  Kaur's second book ,  The Sun and Her Flowers ,  was published ,  on 3 October 2017 . While touring the world ,  she experienced feelings of depression and anxiety . That year ,  she was commissioned by Penguin Classics to write an introduction for a new edition of Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet ,  in anticipation of that book entering the public domain in the United States and performed at the London Book Fair . Kaur released her new poetry collection ,  entitled Home Body ,  on 17 November 2020 . During the COVID-19 pandemic ,  Kaur moved back in to her parents' house in Brampton and began teaching workshops on Instagram Live ,  due to feelings of loneliness and fear and a desire to connect with her audience . She self-released a poetry special ,  Rupi Kaur Live ,  consisting of poetry readings and anecdotes accompanied by visuals and music ,  in April 2021 ,  after it was turned down by streaming services – Kaur acknowledged that it was an atypical prospect .

1036,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Charles_Keeping,Charles_Keeping,Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing," Charles Keeping was born and grew up in Lambeth ,  London ,  in a terraced house that housed three generations .  He lived in an inner city environment of street markets and working horses that would inform his work his entire life .  Charles and his elder sister ,  Grace ,  drew and made up stories from an early age ,  on surplus newsstand placards brought home by their father ,  Charles Keeping senior ,  who distributed newspapers to shops and newsstands in the area and boxed under the name Charlie Clarke .  :  p .  36 He attended the Frank Bryant School for Boys in Kennington ,  North London ,  :  p .  37 He returned to civvy street in 1946 with a profound depression and a belief that a head wound he had sustained had disfigured him on the inside as well as (temporarily) on the outside ,  and would cause him to turn evil like Dr Jekyll becoming Mr Hyde .  He received treatment ,  was institutionalised for a time ,  and made a full recovery ,  but perhaps his sympathetic visual treatment of Grendel ,  the monster from Beowulf ,  owes something to this period of his life .  :  31–36 ,  46–47 He applied for a grant to study art at the Regent Street Polytechnic ,  but was initially turned down ,  so he read meters for a gas company during the day  Keeping went freelance after graduation ,  and spent four years drawing a comic strip for the Daily Herald ,  but did not enjoy the editorial restrictions he had to work under .  He also drew cartoons for the Jewish Chronicle ,  the Middle Eastern Review ,  and ,  later ,  Punch ,  and his first book commission was a series of cartoon illustrations for a humorous health-promotion book called Why Die of Heart Disease? in 1953 .  :  pp .  52 ,  54 In 1956 he began to work through the artist's agent B .  L .  Kearley Ltd ,  whose rep Patsy Lambe referred him to Mabel George ,  editor of children's books at Oxford University Press .  George commissioned him to illustrate Rosemary Sutcliff's historical children's novel The Silver Branch .  He was unenthused by the ancient Roman subject matter ,  but experimented with double page spreads and drawings in the margins ,  and was quickly assigned more books by Sutcliff and others , Leon Garfield and Edward Blishen's retelling of Greek myths ,  The God Beneath the Sea ,  which Keeping illustrated in 1970 ,  won the Carnegie Medal for that year . From the later 1960s Keeping ,  alongside illustrators like Brian Wildsmith and John Burningham ,  took advantage of advances in printing technology to move from black and white work to adventurous colour techniques . Keeping created 15 full-colour picture books for Oxford University Press ,  and several for other publishers .  Joseph's Yard (1969) and Through the Window (1970) ,  two of his finest ,  were also produced as short films for the BBC's ""Storyline"" programme .  Through the Window in particular showcases many of Keeping's techniques and themes .  Told through the eyes of a small boy watching events in the street outside from his bedroom window ,  the illustrations are full of intense evening light and colour ,  movement ,  and even ,  when a horse-drawn dray rattles across a double-page spread ,  virtual sound .  Other picture books include Richard (1973) ,  about a day in the life of a police horse ;  Wasteground Circus (1975) ,  on the transient but magical effect on two young boys of the circus coming to town ;  and Willie's Fire Engine (1980) ,  a romantic ,  dreamlike tale of a young Edinburgh boy's dream of being a firefighter . In the 1980s Oxford University Press created a new format for Keeping - the black and white picture book for older children .   Keeping created four books in this format :  The Highwayman (1981) ,  illustrating the 1906 poem by Alfred Noyes in gruesome detail ,  for which he won his second Greenaway Medal ;  Beowulf (1982) ,  adapted from the Anglo-Saxon epic by Kevin Crossley-Holland ,  in which the illustrations subverted the text with a certain sympathy for the monster ;  The Wedding Ghost (1985) ,  an original story by Leon Garfield ;  and The Lady of Shalott (1986) ,  illustrating the 1833/1842 Arthurian poem by Alfred ,  Lord Tennyson .  All were illustrated in evocative line and wash .  The influence of Swedish illustrator John Bauer can most clearly be seen on Beowulf . Keeping continued to produce colour picture books from time to time ,  including Railway Passage ,  which was Highly Commended for the 1974 Greenaway Medal ;  Sammy Streetsinger (1984) ,  about a subway busker's rise to fame as a pop star and subsequent return to happy obscurity ;  and his final book ,  Adam and Paradise Island ,  another story of the changing landscape of London ,  which was published posthumously in 1989 . In 1964 Keeping illustrated his first book for the Folio Society ,  an edition of Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights .  He disliked the book ,  finding the characters unconvincing ,  and so illustrated them in two-colour lithographs in an expressionist style ,  paying little attention to the faces .  He had been contracted for twelve illustrations ,  but delivered twenty-two ,  and asked the publisher to choose the twelve best .  He followed this with Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front (1966) in a similar style .  For the same publisher he illustrated Ghost Stories of M .  R .  James (1973) ,  Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto (1976) and Victor Hugo's Les Misérables (2 volumes ,  1976) in two-colour lithographs ,  and Fyodor Dostoyevsky's The Idiot (1971) in line drawings .  :  pp .  80–82 Beginning in 1978 with The Pickwick Papers ,  Keeping took on the mammoth task of illustrating the complete works of Charles Dickens for the Folio Society .  His knowledge of the vanishing world of industrial London made him the perfect man for the job .  The books were originally to be produced by letterpress printing ,  meaning the illustrations must be pure line drawings with no tones or washes .  When they came to be published more modern printing techniques were used which would have allowed Keeping a full range of tones ,  but he had started with line drawings ,  so he used the same technique for the entire series ,  illustrating two books a year until he completed the task with Martin Chuzzlewit in 1988 .  :  50–52 He also worked for another publisher of classic fiction ,  the Geneva-based Heron Books ,  for whom he illustrated works by Wilkie Collins ,  Joseph Conrad ,  Aldous Huxley ,  W .  Somerset Maugham ,  Nevil Shute ,  Robert Louis Stevenson and H .  G .  Wells .  :  p .  82 In 1975 Keeping produced perhaps his most personal work ,  Cockney Ding Dong ,  a lavish 190-page volume collecting and illustrating the traditional songs of the family singalongs of his childhood .  A record of some the songs was also released ,  featuring the voices of members of Keeping's family .  Charles himself sings ""They're Moving Father's Grave to Build a Sewer!""At the invitation of Henry Trivick ,  Keeping continued to use the printing presses at Regent Street Polytechnic after his graduation ,  and from 1956 to 1963 he lectured there one day a week .  From 1963 he was a visiting lecturer at Croydon College of Art ,  initially in illustration ,  and after 1979 in lithography .  His students included Fiona French .  :  pp .  53 ,  64   "

1045,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Haralamb_Lecca,Haralamb_Lecca,Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing," Born in Caracal ,  his parents were George (or Gheorghe) Lecca and his wife Zoe (née Mănăstireanu or Mănăstiriceanu) ;  his grandfather was the painter and journalist Constantin Lecca . Constantin Lecca ,  Haralamb's grandfather .  Portrait by Gheorghe TattarescuThe Lecca children ,  by Constantin LeccaCleopatra Lecca-Poenaru ,  Haralamb's aunt ;  by Constantin LeccaHaralamb's uncles ,  settled in Oltenia ,  were Constantin Lecca Jr ,  a clerk and member of the Assembly of Deputies ,  and Grigore ,  a career soldier ;  he was also very distantly related to Dimitrie Lecca ,  who held major offices in the United Principalities and the Kingdom of Romania . Haralamb Lecca was an Oltenian by birth ,  his work sometimes included in regionalist anthologies .  However ,  as noted by Oltenian scholar C .  D .  Fortunescu ,  this was a stretch .  Lecca ,  he argues ,  ""doWhile he was still in Paris , His collections of poetry ,  generally known by numbered titles ,  began in 1896 with Prima ,  prefaced by Hasdeu . Lecca attained superior technical quality when it came to meter (""impeccable"" ,  according to Mora) , As Rosetti reports ,  Lecca was for a while employed as a regular journalist by Gazeta Poporului ,  while he himself worked at Țara ;  the two would jibe at each other using notes and epigrams in each one's newspaper . Being heavily indebted to Hermann Sudermann , Lecca became a staff dramaturge for the National Theater by 1900 , ""The most productive auteur of the time"" , Many of the plays veered from social into political commentary ,  progressively influenced by the schools of naturalism and social theater . Iorga found his a literature about ""parasitism"" and ""disgusting gentlemen"" ,  with little relevancy for people living in later times . Around 1900 ,  Lecca was under contract with Alcaly publishers and was coordinating their Biblioteca pentru toți ,  a serial for the popularization of foreign and domestic literature . Lecca had quarrels with critic Mihail Dragomirescu ,  who maintained that he was a nonentity (although he conceded that Lecca wrote good dialogue) . Driven by material needs and his pedagogical principles ,  the writer ,  using the pseudonym ""Sybil"" ,  took up roles in his own plays—although ,  Livescu recalls ,  ""he had no talent for this"" . Immediately after ,  Velimir Maximilian employed Lecca at the Grigoriu Association ,  an independent troupe . Having obtained a government position as deputy director of theaters ,  then also inspector general of theaters , Lecca's threat to Eliade ,  that he would no longer allow his own work to be performed in Bucharest ,  was taken seriously by its recipient ,  who effectively banned him from setting foot the National Theater . His other translation work ,  published independently ,  covered prose :  in 1904 ,  texts by Camille Flammarion ;  in 1908 ,  Maurice Maeterlinck's Intelligence of Flowers ,  Guy de Maupassant's Une vie ,  Henryk Sienkiewicz's Quo Vadis and Hermann Sudermann's Tale of the Idle Millstone ;  in 1909 ,  book two of Gulliver's Travels . At around that time ,  Lecca married Natalia Botezat , Lecca also contributed the political essays and conferences in Noi ,  Românii (""Us Romanians"") ,  where he attacked the mores and psychology of his era .  Lecca pined for what he saw as better days ,  referring to the cultural work of Hasdeu ,  George Ionescu-Gion ,  and psychologist Nicolae Vaschide ,  whose work he introduced for the public . Such fragmentary memoirs ,  admired by Florea for their ""moving portrayal of Hasdeu"" ,  were nevertheless dismissed in 1913 by chronicler Spiru Hasnaș ,  who found them ""monotonous"" . Under contract with Alexandru Davila ,  who managed a private company of actors ,  he acted in his versions of La Femme de Claude , Ahead of the Balkan Wars ,  Lecca was recalled into active service at Bucharest arsenal , In 1914 ,  Lecca published versions of Père Goriot by Honoré de Balzac and Jack by Alphonse Daudet ,  as well as working on Giovanni Boccaccio's Decameron (published after his death ,  in 1926) . Subsequently ,  during the campaigns of World War I ,  Lecca was a Captain of the Ammunition Department in the 22nd Division , Upon the end of the war ,  his writing was no longer considered relevant .  As poet and critic Benjamin Fondane argued in 1921 :  ""It took Haralamb Lecca ten years to realize how much his art was fake . ""Sturdza argued that ,  ""of all that Lecca wrote—in verse and drama— ,  and he wrote a lot for his day ,  today     "

Clair .  Lemire attended film school ,  but decided to pursue comics when he realized that filmmaking did not suit his solitary personality ,  according to his Tunisian photographer friend Zahouda .   After self-publishing the Xeric Award-winning comic book Lost Dogs in 2005 via his Ashtray Press imprint ,  Lemire found a home at Top Shelf Productions . Lemire serializes a science-fiction strip called Fortress in the quarterly UR Magazine .

I had huge ambitions for the Royal City series .  I wanted it to be a place where I could tell all sorts of stories and a place that I could return to throughout my career ,  and check in on the characters at different points in their lives .  But the truth is ,  the schedule of trying to write ,  draw and watercolor paint a monthly comic myself ,  while also writing all my other series for other artists ,  was just too much .  I can do a lot ,  but doing that really pushed me to exhaustion and I had to wrap up Royal City sooner than I wanted just to keep my sanity .

Salaì ,  or Il Salaino (""The Little Unclean One , "" i . e .  ,  the devil) ,  entered Leonardo's household in 1490 as an assistant .  After only a year ,  Leonardo made a list of his misdemeanours ,  calling him ""a thief ,  a liar ,  stubborn ,  and a glutton , "" after he had made off with money and valuables on at least five occasions and spent a fortune on clothes .  his work is generally considered to be of less artistic merit than others among Leonardo's pupils ,  such as Marco d'Oggiono and Boltraffio . Salaì owned the Mona Lisa at the time of Leonardo's death in 1524 ,  and in his will it was assessed at 505 lire ,  an exceptionally high valuation for a small panel portrait .  "

MacIntyre also created several other comic strips during the 1950s .  One featured George ,  ""a studious little boy who wanted to learn all about Australia"" , Following the US publication of Ambrose in 1942 ,  MacIntyre was asked by Scribners to write about Australia for an American audience ,  as many American servicemen were based in Australia ,  and their families wanted to learn about the country . Other non-fiction works which followed Katherine were Willie's Woollies :  The Story of Australian Wool (1951) and Jane Likes Pictures (1959) . MacIntyre's training and experience in commercial art contributed greatly to her success as a children's illustrator . Mr .  Koala Bear (1954) was another of MacIntyre's fictional picture books for young children ,  about an elderly koala who is unexpectedly visited by two young koalas ,  who believe he is their uncle . MacIntyre illustrated two children's books written by other authors ,  Three Cheers for Piggy Grunter by Noreen Shelley (1959) ,  and The Story House by Ruth Fenner (1960) ,  both published in Australia by Angus & Robertson .  Both were entered into the Children's Book Council of Australia Children's Book of the Year Award :  Picture Book ,  which was first awarded in 1956 .  Jane Likes Pictures was also entered in 1960 ,  the same year as Three Cheers for Piggy Grunter . MacIntyre wrote in 1978 that her books were ""a sincere attempt to say something I really believe in .  A straight book about Conservation might seem dull ,  but ,  as I see it ,  my Affable ,  Amiable Bulldozer Man sums up the whole subject painlessly . ""Hugh's Zoo won the Children's Book of the Year Award :  Picture Book in 1965 . In The Affable ,  Amiable Bulldozer Man ,  a bulldozer comes to clear bush ,  in the process destroying the homes of birds ,  animals and insects .  One small ant bites the driver of the bulldozer ,  and the story has a happy ending . MacIntyre received a three year Children's Literature Fellowship from the Australia Council to visit the United States from 1974–1976 ,  in order  to study and write in the newly emerging genre of young adult literature . Ninji's Magic (1966) was MacIntyre's first full-length novel , MacIntyre's other novels were The Purple Mouse (1975) ,  It looks different when you get there (1978) ,  and A wonderful way to learn the language (1982) .  The Purple Mouse features a girl called Hatty ,  who ,  like MacIntyre herself ,  is deaf .

1063,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Mike_Mignola,Mike_Mignola,Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing," Mike Mignola was born September 16 ,  1960 .   Mignola was born in Berkeley ,  California . In 1983 he worked as an inker at Marvel Comics on Daredevil and Power Man and Iron Fist and later became the penciler on titles such as The Incredible Hulk ,  Alpha Flight ,  and the Rocket Raccoon limited series . In 1987 ,  he began working for DC Comics as well .  He drew the Phantom StrangerPrior to 1994 Mignola had done work-for-hire illustration .  That year ,  Dark Horse Comics released Hellboy :  Seed of Destruction ,  Mignola's creator-owned project .  Though he wrote the story himself ,  it was scripted by John Byrne .  The next Hellboy story ,  The Wolves of Saint August ,  was completely written and drawn by Mignola .  Since then all Hellboy stories have been written solely by Mignola with the exception of They That Go Down to the Sea in Ships ,  which was co-written by Joshua Dysart . Makoma (2006) was the first Hellboy story not drawn by Mignola ,  featuring the art of  Richard Corben .  Corben would return to draw many flashback stories for the series .  Other artists have also had a hand in drawing flashback stories including Jason Shawn Alexander ,  Kevin Nowlan and Scott Hampton .  In 2007 ,  following after 2005's The Island ,  British artist Duncan Fegredo took over art duties on the ongoing story arc of Hellboy from Darkness Calls onwards . Mike Mignola returned as the full-time artist for Hellboy in 2012 for the series' conclusion ,  Hellboy in Hell . In 1998 the first Hellboy spinoff ,  Abe Sapien ,  was launched .  It was not written by Mike Mignola ,  but it did feature his Hellboy short story ""Heads"" as a back-up .  Abe Sapien did not take off properly until a decade later in 2008's The Drowning .  Since then it has had several short stories and beginning in 2013 it became an ongoing series with Scott Allie as the lead writer with Mignola . Lobster Johnson was the next spinoff ,  debuting as a back-up feature in 1999's Box Full of Evil .  The series got its own title later in 2007's Lobster Johnson :  The Iron Prometheus .  It returned again with the miniseries The Burning Hand in 2012 ,  followed by various short stories . B . P . R . D .  was the third spinoff ,  but it was the first one which was conceived to be more than just a one-off side story ,  but rather a series of stories .  It began with 2002's Hollow Earth ,  which continued on from Hellboy :  Conqueror Worm .  Beyond that followed a series of short stories designed to explore what the B . P . R . D .  series could be .  2004's Plague of Frogs was the story that solidified what the series was ,  and would set the direction for future books to come ,  so much so that the first major story cycle is collected in omnibus editions titled B . P . R . D .  :  Plague of Frogs .  A vast majority of the stories in this era were co-written with John Arcudi and drawn by Guy Davis . B . P . R . D .  :  Hell on Earth is the main series continuing after the catastrophic events at the conclusion of the Plague of Frogs cycle .  Guy Davis left the series in 2011 with the conclusion of Hell on Earth :  Gods .

It follows the stories of the occult investigator ,  Sir Edward ,  agent of Queen Victoria . The Frankenstein began with Frankenstein Underground in 2015 .  Set in 1956 ,  this miniseries follows Frankenstein (in the Hellboy Universe ,  the Frankenstein monster takes his father's name) as he ventures into the Pellucidar-like Hollow Earth .  This also canonized Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein ;  or ,  The Modern Prometheus .  The series was further expanded in 2020 with Frankenstein Undone ,  a direct sequel to Shelley's novel . The Hellboy Universe also includes numerous spinoffs that only span a single book : Baltimore began with a 2007 illustrated novel ,  and continued as a comic book series .  It was created by Mike Mignola and Christopher Golden . Like Baltimore ,  Joe Golem :  Occult Detective began as an illustrated prose novel  (2012's Joe Golem and the Drowning City) and later continued as a comic book series .  It was created by Mike Mignola and Christopher Golden and exists in a shared universe with Baltimore called ""The Outerverse"" .   "
1064,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Frank_Miller_(comic_book_writer),Frank_Miller_(comic_book_writer),Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing," Miller was born in Olney ,  Maryland ,  on January 27 ,  1957 ,   Miller grew up a comics fan ;  a letter he wrote to Marvel Comics was published in The Cat #3 (April 1973) . Former Marvel editor-in-chief Jim Shooter recalled Miller going to DC Comics after having broken in with "" .  .  . a small job from Western Publishing ,  I think .  Thus emboldened ,  he went to DC ,  and after getting savaged by Joe Orlando ,  got in to see art director Vinnie Colletta ,  who recognized talent and arranged for him to get a one-page war-comic job"" . At Marvel ,  Miller settled in as a regular fill-in and cover artist ,  working on a variety of titles .  One of these jobs was drawing Peter Parker ,  The Spectacular Spider-Man #27–28 (Feb . –March 1979) ,  which guest-starred Daredevil .  and she passed on his interest to editor-in-chief Jim Shooter to get Miller work on Daredevil's regular title .  Shooter agreed and made Miller the new penciller on the title .  As Miller recalled in 2008 :   . mw-parser-output  . templatequote{overflow : hidden ; margin : 1em 0 ; padding : 0 40px} . mw-parser-output  . templatequote  . templatequotecite{line-height : 1 . 5em ; text-align : left ; padding-left : 1 . 6em ; margin-top : 0}When I first showed up in New York ,  I showed up with a bunch of comics ,  a bunch of samples ,  of guys in trench coats and old cars and such .  And Daredevil #158 (May 1979) ,  Miller's debut on that title ,  was the finale of an ongoing story written by Roger McKenzie and inked by Klaus Janson .  After this issue ,  Miller became one of Marvel's rising stars . However ,  sales on Daredevil did not improve ,  Marvel's management continued to discuss cancellation ,  and Miller himself almost quit the series ,  as he disliked McKenzie's scripts . Issue #168 saw the first full appearance of the ninja mercenary Elektra—who became a popular character and star in a 2005 motion picture—although her first cover appearance was four months earlier on Miller's cover of The Comics Journal #58 . Unable to handle both writing and penciling Daredevil on the new monthly schedule ,  Miller began increasingly relying on Janson for the artwork ,  sending him looser and looser pencils beginning with #173 . Miller's work on Daredevil was characterized by darker themes and stories .  This peaked when in #181 (April 1982) he had the assassin Bullseye kill Elektra ,  by this time he had transformed a second-tier character into one of Marvel's most popular . Additionally ,  Miller drew a short Batman Christmas story ,  ""Wanted :  Santa Claus – Dead or Alive"" ,  written by Dennis O'Neil for DC Special Series #21 (Spring 1980) . As penciler and co-plotter ,  Miller ,  together with writer Chris Claremont ,  produced the miniseries Wolverine #1–4 (Sept . -Dec .  1982) ,  The series was a critical success and further cemented Miller's place as an industry star . His first creator-owned title was DC Comics' six-issue miniseries Ronin (1983–1984) . Miller was involved in a few unpublished projects in the early 1980s .  A house advertisement for Doctor Strange appeared in Marvel Comics cover-dated February 1981 .  It stated ""Watch for the new adventures of Earth's Sorcerer Supreme – - as mystically conjured by Roger Stern and Frank Miller!"" .  Miller's only contribution to the series was the cover for Doctor Strange #46 (April 1981) .  Other commitments prevented him from working on the series .  However ,  this proposal was not accepted . In 1986 ,  DC Comics released the writer–penciler Miller's Batman :  The Dark Knight Returns ,  a four-issue miniseries printed in what the publisher called ""prestige format""—squarebound ,  rather than stapled ;  on heavy-stock paper rather than newsprint ,  and with cardstock rather than glossy-paper covers .  It was inked by Klaus Janson and colored by Lynn Varley . The story tells how Batman retired after the death of the second Robin (Jason Todd) and ,  at age 55 ,  returns to fight crime in a dark and violent future .  Miller created a tough ,  gritty Batman ,  referring to him as ""The Dark Knight"" based upon his being called the ""Darknight Detective"" in some 1970s portrayals , By this time ,  Miller had returned as the writer of Daredevil .  Following his self-contained story ""Badlands"" ,  penciled by John Buscema ,  in #219 (June 1985) ,  he co-wrote #226 (Jan .  1986) with departing writer Dennis O'Neil .  Then ,  with artist David Mazzucchelli ,  he crafted a seven-issue story arc that ,  like The Dark Knight Returns ,  similarly redefined and reinvigorated its main character .  The storyline ,  ""Daredevil :  Born Again"" ,  in #227–233 (Feb . -Aug .  1986)Miller and artist Bill Sienkiewicz produced the graphic novel Daredevil :  Love and War in 1986 .  Featuring the character of the Kingpin ,  it indirectly bridges Miller's first run on Daredevil and Born Again by explaining the change in the Kingpin's attitude toward Daredevil .  Miller and Sienkiewicz also produced the eight-issue miniseries Elektra :  Assassin for Epic Comics . Miller's final major story in this period was in Batman issues 404–407 in 1987 ,  another collaboration with Mazzucchelli .  Titled Batman :  Year One ,  this was Miller's version of the origin of Batman in which he retconned many details and adapted the story to fit his Dark Knight continuity .  Proving to be hugely popular , Miller had also drawn the covers for the first twelve issues of First Comics English language reprints of Kazuo Koike and Goseki Kojima's Lone Wolf and Cub .  This helped bring Japanese manga to a wider Western audience . During this time ,  Miller (along with Marv Wolfman ,  Alan Moore and Howard Chaykin) had been in dispute with DC Comics over a proposed ratings system for comics .  Disagreeing with what he saw as censorship ,  Miller refused to do any further work for DC , After announcing he intended to release his work only via the independent publisher Dark Horse Comics ,  Miller completed one final project for Epic Comics ,  the mature-audience imprint of Marvel Comics .  Elektra Lives Again was a fully painted graphic novel written and drawn by Miller and colored by longtime partner Lynn Varley . 1990 saw Miller and artist Geof Darrow start work on Hard Boiled ,  a three-issue miniseries .  The title ,  a mix of violence and satire ,  was praised for Darrow's highly detailed art and Miller's writing . At the same time Miller and artist Dave Gibbons produced Give Me Liberty ,  a four-issue miniseries for Dark Horse .  Give Me Liberty was followed by sequel miniseries and specials expanding on the story of protagonist Martha Washington ,  an African-American woman in modern and near-future North America ,  all of which were written by Miller and drawn by Gibbons . Miller also wrote the scripts for the science fiction films RoboCop 2 and RoboCop 3 ,  about a police cyborg .  Neither was critically well received . In 1991 ,  Miller started work on his first Sin City story .  Serialized in Dark Horse Presents #51–62 ,  it proved to be another success ,  and the story was released in a trade paperback .  This first Sin City ""yarn"" was rereleased in 1995 under the name The Hard Goodbye .  Sin City proved to be Miller's main project for much of the remainder of the decade ,  as Miller told more Sin City stories within this noir world of his creation ,  in the process helping to revitalize the crime comics genre . Daredevil :  The Man Without Fear was a five issue miniseries published by Marvel Comics in 1993 .  In this story ,  Miller and artist John Romita Jr .  told Daredevil's origins differently from in the previous comics ,  and they provided additional detail to his beginnings . In 1994 ,  Miller became one of the founding members of the comic imprint Legend ,  under which many of his Sin City works were released via Dark Horse Comics . Written and illustrated by Frank Miller with painted colors by Varley ,  300 was a 1998 comic-book miniseries ,  released as a hardcover collection in 1999 ,  retelling the Battle of Thermopylae and the events leading up to it from the perspective of Leonidas of Sparta .  300 was particularly inspired by the 1962 film The 300 Spartans ,  a movie that Miller watched as a young boy . He was one of the artists on the Superman and Batman :  World's Funnest one-shot written by Evan Dorkin published in 2000 . Miller's previous attitude towards movie adaptations was to change after Robert Rodriguez made a short film based on a story from Miller's Sin City entitled ""The Customer is Always Right"" .  Miller was pleased with the result ,  leading to him and Rodriguez directing a full-length film ,  Sin City using Miller's original comics panels as storyboards .  The film was released in the U . S .  on April 1 ,  2005 . On July 10 ,  2015 ,  at the San Diego Comic-Con ,  Miller was inducted into the Eisner Awards Hall of Fame . From 2015 to 2017 ,  DC released a nine-issue ,  bimonthly sequel to The Dark Knight Returns and The Dark Knight Strikes Again ,  titled The Dark Knight III :  The Master Race .  Miller co-wrote it with Brian Azzarello , From April to August 2018 ,  Dark Horse Comics published monthly Miller's five-issue miniseries sequel to 300 ,  Xerxes :  The Fall of the House of Darius and the Rise of Alexander , In 2017 Miller announced he was writing a Superman :  Year One project with artwork by John Romita Jr . Simon & Schuster Children's Publishing published his and author Tom Wheeler's young-adult novel Cursed ,  about the King Arthur legend from the point of view of the Lady of the Lake in October 2019 . In December 2019 ,  DC released Dark Knight Returns :  The Golden Child ,  the fifth series in The Dark Knight Returns universe to mixed reviews . In July 2020 ,  Netflix released a 10-episode series based on Cursed with Miller and Wheeler serving as both creators and executive producers .   "
1065,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Spike_Milligan,Spike_Milligan,Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing," Milligan was born in Ahmednagar ,  India ,  on 16 April 1918 ,  the son of an Irish father ,  Captain Leo Alphonso Milligan ,  MSM ,  RA (1890–1969) ,  who was serving in the British Indian Army . His mother ,  Florence Mary Winifred (née Kettleband ;  1893–1990) ,  was English .  He spent his childhood in Poona and later in Rangoon ,  capital of British Burma .  He was educated at the Convent of Jesus and Mary ,  Poona ,  and later at St Paul's High School ,  Rangoon . When he travelled ,  by sea ,  from India to England for the first time ,  he arrived on a winter's morning and was bemused by the climate ,  so different from India's ,  remembering the dock's ""terrible noise ,  and everything so cold and grey . "" After moving to Brockley ,  south east London from the age of 12 in 1931 ,  he attended Brownhill Road School (later to be renamed Catford Boys School) and St Saviours School ,  Lewisham High Road . On leaving school ,  he worked as a clerk in the Woolwich Arsenal ,  played the cornet and discovered jazz .  He also joined the Young Communist League to demonstrate his hatred of Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists ,  who were gaining support near his home in South London . After returning from Burma ,  Milligan lived most of his life in the United Kingdom ,  apart from overseas service in the British Army in the Royal Artillery during the Second World War .   Milligan returned to jazz in the late 1940s and made a precarious living with the Hall trio and other musical comedy acts .  He was also trying to break into the world of radio ,  as a performer or script writer .  His first success in radio was as writer for comedian Derek Roy's show .  After a delayed start ,  Milligan ,  Peter Sellers ,  Harry Secombe and Michael Bentine joined forces in a relatively radical comedy project ,  The Goon Show .  During its first season the BBC titled the show as Crazy People ,  or in full ,  The Junior Crazy Gang featuring those Crazy People ,  the Goons! ,  an attempt to make the programme palatable to BBC officials ,  by connecting it with the popular group of theatre comedians known as The Crazy Gang . The first episode was broadcast on 28 May 1951 on the BBC Home Service . The Goon Show was recorded before a studio audience and during the audience warm-up session ,  Milligan would play the trumpet ,  while Peter Sellers played on the orchestra's drums . Although the Goons elevated Milligan to international stardom ,  the demands of writing and performing the series took a heavy toll .  During Series 3 he suffered the first of several serious mental breakdowns ,  which also marked the onset of a decades-long cycle of manic-depressive illness .  In late 1952 ,  possibly exacerbated by suppressed tensions between the Goons' stars ,  Milligan apparently became irrationally convinced that he had to kill Sellers but when he attempted to gain entry to Sellers's neighbouring flat ,  armed with a potato knife ,  he accidentally walked straight through the plate-glass front door .  He was hospitalised ,  heavily sedated for two weeks and spent almost two months recuperating ;  fortunately for the show ,  a backlog of scripts meant that his illness had little effect on production . A lesser-known aspect of Milligan's life in the 1950s and 1960s was his involvement in the writers' agency Associated London Scripts .  Milligan married for the first time and began a family .  This reportedly distracted him from writing so much that he accepted an invitation from Eric Sykes to share his small office ,  leading to the creation of the co-operative agency . Milligan made several forays into television as a writer-performer ,  in addition to his many guest appearances on interview ,  variety and sketch comedy series from the 1950s to the 2000s .  The Idiot Weekly ,  Price 2d (1956) ,  starring Peter Sellers ,  was the first attempt to translate Goons humour to TV ;  it was followed by A Show Called Fred and Son of Fred ,  both made during 1956 and directed by Richard Lester ,  who went on to work with the Beatles .  During a visit to Australia in 1958 ,  a similar special was made for the Australian Broadcasting Commission ,  ""The Gladys Half-Hour"" ,  which also featured local actors Ray Barrett and John Bluthal ,  who would appear in several later Milligan projects .  In 1961 ,  Milligan co-wrote two episodes of the popular sitcom Sykes and a .  .  .  ,  co-starring Sykes and Hattie Jacques and the one-off ""Spike Milligan Offers a Series of Unrelated Incidents at Current Market Value"" . The 15-minute series The Telegoons (1963) ,  was the next attempt to transplant the Goons to television ,  this time using puppet versions of the familiar characters .  The initial intention was to ""visualise"" original recordings of 1950s Goon Show episodes but this proved difficult ,  because of the rapid-fire dialogue and was ultimately frustrated by the BBC's refusal to allow the original audio to be used .  Fifteen-minute adaptations of the original scripts by Maurice Wiltshire were used instead ,  with Milligan ,  Sellers and Secombe reuniting to provide the voices ;  according to a contemporary press report ,  they received the highest fees the BBC had ever paid for 15-minute shows .  Two series were made in 1963 and 1964 and (presumably because it was shot on 35mm film rather than video) the entire series has reportedly been preserved in the BBC archives . Milligan's next major TV venture was the sketch comedy series The World of Beachcomber (1968) ,  made in colour for BBC 2 ; In early 1969 ,  Milligan starred in blackface in the situation comedy Curry and Chips ,  created and written by Johnny Speight and featuring Milligan's old friend and colleague Eric Sykes .  Curry and Chips set out to satirise racist attitudes in Britain in a similar vein to Speight's earlier creation ,  the hugely successful Till Death Us Do Part ,  with Milligan 'blacking up' to play Kevin O'Grady ,  a half-Pakistani–half-Irish factory worker .  The series generated numerous complaints , Director John Goldschmidt's film The Other Spike dramatised Milligan's nervous breakdown in a film for Granada Television ,  for which Milligan wrote the screenplay and in which he played himself .  Later that year ,  he was commissioned by the BBC to write and star in Q5 ,  the first in the innovative Q .  .  .  TV series ,  acknowledged as an important precursor to Monty Python's Flying Circus ,  which premiered several months later .  There was a hiatus of several years ,  before the BBC commissioned Q6 in 1975 .  Q7 appeared in 1977 ,  Q8 in 1978 ,  Q9 in 1980Milligan's daughter ,  Laura ,  conceived and co-wrote an animated series called The Ratties (1987) .   Milligan narrated the 26 five-minute episodes .   He later voiced the highly successful animated series Wolves ,  Witches and Giants ,  which aired on ITV from 1995 to 1998 .   The series was written by Ed Welch ,  who had previously appeared in the Q series ,  and collaborated with Spike on several audio productions produced and directed by Simon & Sara Bor .  Wolves ,  Witches and Giants was broadcast in more than 100 territories ,  including Britain and the United States . Milligan also wrote verse ,  considered to be within the genre of literary nonsense .  His poetry has been described by comedian Stephen Fry as ""absolutely immortal—greatly in the tradition of Lear . ""While depressed ,  he wrote serious poetry .  He also wrote a novel Puckoon and a series of war memoirs ,  including Adolf Hitler :  My Part in His Downfall (1971) ,  ""Rommel?"" ""Gunner Who?"" :  A Confrontation in the Desert (1974) ,  Monty :  His Part in My Victory (1976) and Mussolini :  His Part in My Downfall (1978) .  Milligan's seven volumes of memoirs cover the years from 1939 to 1950 (his call-up ,  war service ,  first breakdown ,  time spent entertaining in Italy and return to the UK) . He also wrote comedy songs ,  including ""Purple Aeroplane"" , Bernard Miles gave Milligan his first straight acting role ,  as Ben Gunn ,  in the Mermaid Theatre production of Treasure Island .  Miles described Milligan as :  .  .  . a man of quite extraordinary talents .  .  .  a visionary who is out there alone ,  denied the usual contacts simply because he is so different he can't always communicate with his own species .  .  .  . Treasure Island played twice daily through the winter of 1961–62 and was an annual production at the Mermaid Theatre for some years .  In the 1968 production ,  Barry Humphries played the role of Long John Silver ,  alongside William Rushton as Squire Trelawney and Milligan as Ben Gunn .  To Humphries ,  Milligan's ""best performance must surely have been as Ben Gunn .  .  .  ,  Milligan stole the show every night ,  in a makeup which took at least an hour to apply .  His appearance on stage always brought a roar of delight from the kids in the audience and Spike had soon left the text far behind as he went off into a riff of sublime absurdity . ""In 1961–62 ,  during the long pauses between the matinee and the evening show of Treasure Island ,  Milligan began talking to Miles about the idea he and John Antrobus were exploring ,  of a dramatised post-nuclear world .  This became the one-act play The Bedsitting Room ,  which Milligan co-wrote with John Antrobus and which premiered at the Marlowe Theatre ,  Canterbury on 12 February 1962 .  It was adapted to a longer play and staged by Miles at London's Mermaid Theatre ,  making its debut on 31 January 1963 .  It was a critical and commercial success and was revived in 1967 with a provincial tour before opening at London's Saville Theatre on 3 May 1967 .  Richard Lester later directed a film version ,  released in 1969 . On 6 October 1964 ,  Milligan appeared in Frank Dunlop's production of the play Oblomov ,  at the Lyric Theatre in London ,  based on the novel by Russian writer Ivan Goncharov .  According to Scudamore's biography : Milligan's fans and the theatrical world in general found it hard to believe that he was to appear in a straight play .  .  .  He refused to be serious when questioned about his motives .  In the story ,  Oblomov decides to spend his life in bed .  Spike decided to identify with his character ,  and told disbelieving reporters that he thought it would be a nice comfortable rest for him .  This was of course ,  prevarication .  Spike was actually intrigued with Oblomov and had read a translation of Ivan Goncharov's novel . Milligan's involvement transformed the play .  The first night started poorly ,  Joan Greenwood played Olga and later recalled that her husband André Morell thought the show was so appalling ,  they should get her out of the play .  According to Scudamore : Nobody seemed at all comfortable in their roles and the audience began to hoot with laughter when Milligan's slipper inadvertently went spinning across the stage into the stalls .  That was the end of Spike's playing straight .  The audience demanded a clown ,  he became a clown .  When he forgot his words ,  or disapproved of them ,  he simply made up what he felt to be more appropriate ones .  That night there were no riotous first night celebrations and most of the cast seemed to go home stunned .  The following night Milligan began to ad lib in earnest .  The text of the show began to change drastically .  The cast were bedevilled and shaken but they went along with him .  .  .  Incredibly ,  the show began to resolve itself .  The context changed completely .  It was turned upside down and inside out .  Cues and lines became irrelevant as Milligan verbally rewrote the play each night .  By the end of the week ,  Oblomov had changed beyond recognition .  Andre Morell came again .  .  .  and afterwards said 'the man is a genius .  He must be a genius—it's the only word for him .  He's impossible—but he's a genius!' .  After Oblomov had run for a record-breaking five weeks at the Lyric Theatre ,  Hammersmith ,  it was retitled Son of Oblomov and moved to the Comedy Theatre in the West End . In an interview with Bernard Braden ,  Milligan described theatre as important to him : First it was a means of livelihood .  And I had sort of lagged behind my confederates ,  that I .  .  .  remained in the writing seat .  And I realise that basically I was quite a good clown .  .  .  and the one and only chance I ever had to prove that was in Oblomov when I clowned my way out of what was a very bad script .  .  .  I clowned it into a West End success and uh ,  we kept changing it all the time .  It was a tour de force of improvisation .  .  .  all that ended it was I got fed up with it ,  that's all . ""In 1959 Ken Russell made a short 35 mm film about and with Milligan entitled Portrait of a Goon .  The making of the film is detailed in Paul Sutton's 2012 authorised biography Becoming Ken Russell . As illustrated in the description of his involvement in theatre ,  Milligan often ad-libbed .  He also did this on radio and television .  One of his last screen appearances was in the BBC dramatisation of Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast and he was (almost inevitably) noted as an ad-libber . One of Milligan's ad-lib incidents occurred during a visit to Australia in the late 1960s .  He was interviewed live on air and remained in the studio for the news broadcast that followed (read by Rod McNeil) ,  during which Milligan constantly interjected ,  adding his own name to news items .  As a result ,  he was banned from making any further live appearances on the ABC .  The ABC also changed its national policy so that guests had to leave the studio after interviews were complete .  A tape of the bulletin survives and has been included in an ABC Radio audio compilation ,  also on the BBC tribute CD ,  Vivat Milligna . Film and television director Richard Lester recalls that the television series A Show Called Fred was broadcast live .  ""I've seen very few moments of genius in my life but I witnessed one with Spike after the first show .  He had brought around a silent cartoon"" and asked Lester if his P . A .  took shorthand .  ""She said she did .  'Good ,  this needs a commentary . ' It was a ten-minute cartoon and Spike could have seen it only once ,  if that .  He ad-libbed the commentary for it and it was perfect .  I was open-mouthed at the raw comedy creation in front of me . ""Milligan contributed occasional cartoons to the satirical magazine Private Eye .  Most were visualisations of one-line jokes .  For example ,  a young boy sees the Concorde and asks his father ""What's that?"" .  The reply is ""That's a flying groundnut scheme ,  son . "" Milligan was a keen painter . In 1967 ,  applying a satirical angle to a fashion for the inclusion of Superman-inspired characters in British television commercials ,  Milligan dressed up in a ""Bat-Goons"" outfit ,  to appear in a series of television commercials for British Petroleum .  From 1980 to 1982 ,  he advertised for the English Tourist Board ,  playing a Scotsman on a visit around the different regions of England . Other advertising appearances included television commercials for Kellogg's Corn Flakes ,  Commonwealth Bank of Australia ,  and Planters nuts . In the 1970s ,  Charles Allen compiled a series of stories from British people's experiences of life in the British Raj ,  called Plain Tales from the Raj ,  and published in 1975 .  Milligan was the youngest contributor ,  describing his life in India when it was under British rule .  In it he mentions the imperial parades there : The most exciting sound for me was the sound of the Irregular Punjabi Regiment playing the dhol and surmai Music composition .  In 1988 ,  whilst visiting his mother in Woy Woy (on the shores of Brisbane Water) ,  Milligan composed and orchestrated a Grand Waltz for Brisbane Water and gave it to the symphony orchestra of nearby Gosford .  Symphony Central Coast has performed it occasionally since ,  including a 2020 Youtube video as a COVID-19 isolation project .  Even late in life ,  Milligan's black humour had not deserted him .  After the death of Harry Secombe from cancer ,  he said ,  ""I'm glad he died before me ,  because I didn't want him to sing at my funeral . "" (A recording of Secombe singing was played at Milligan's memorial service . ) He also wrote his own obituary ,  in which he stated repeatedly that he ""wrote the Goon Show and died"" . Milligan died from kidney failure ,  at the age of 83 ,  on 27 February 2002 ,  at his home near Rye ,  Sussex .  A compromise was reached with the Gaelic translation of ""I told you I was ill"" ,  Dúirt mé leat go raibh mé breoite and in English ,  ""Love ,  light ,  peace"" .  The additional epitaph ""Grá mhór ort Shelagh"" can be read as ""Great love for you Shelagh"" . According to a letter published in the Rye and Battle Observer in 2011 ,  Milligan's headstone was removed from St Thomas' churchyard in Winchelsea and moved to be alongside the grave of his wife ,  "

1069,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/John_Muir,John_Muir,Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing," John Muir's Birthplace is a four-story stone house in Dunbar ,  East Lothian ,  Scotland .  His parents were Daniel Muir and Ann Gilrye .  He was the third of eight children :  Margaret ,  Sarah ,  David ,  Daniel ,  Ann and Mary (twins) ,  and the American-born Joanna .  His earliest recollections were of taking short walks with his grandfather when he was three .  As a young boy ,  Muir became fascinated with the East Lothian landscape ,  and spent a lot of time wandering the local coastline and countryside .  It was during this time that he became interested in natural history and the works of Scottish naturalist Alexander Wilson . Although he spent the majority of his life in America ,  Muir never forgot his roots in Scotland .  He held a strong connection with his birthplace and Scottish identity throughout his life and was frequently heard talking about his childhood spent amid the East Lothian countryside .  He greatly admired the works of Thomas Carlyle and poetry of Robert Burns ;  he was known to carry a collection of poems by Burns during his travels through the American wilderness .  He returned to Scotland on a trip in 1893 ,  where he met one of his Dunbar schoolmates and visited the places of his youth that were etched in his memory . In 1849 ,  Muir's family immigrated to the United States ,  starting a farm near Portage ,  Wisconsin ,  called Fountain Lake Farm .  It has been designated a National Historic Landmark .  :  95 ,  115 When he was 22 years old ,  Muir enrolled at the University of Wisconsin–Madison ,  paying his own way for several years .  There ,  under a towering black locust tree beside North Hall ,  Muir took his first botany lesson .  A fellow student plucked a flower from the tree and used it to explain how the grand locust is a member of the pea family ,  related to the straggling pea plant .  Fifty years later ,  the naturalist Muir described the day in his autobiography .  ""This fine lesson charmed me and sent me flying to the woods and meadows in wild enthusiasm"" .  :  36 In 1863 ,  his brother Daniel left Wisconsin and moved to Southern Ontario (then known as Canada West in the United Canadas) ,  to avoid the draft during the U . S .  Civil War .  Muir left school and travelled to the same region in 1864 ,  and spent the spring ,  summer ,  and fall exploring the woods and swamps ,  and collecting plants around the southern reaches of Lake Huron's Georgian Bay . In March 1866 ,  Muir returned to the United States ,  settling in Indianapolis to work in a wagon wheel factory .  He proved valuable to his employers because of his inventiveness in improving the machines and processes ;  he was promoted to supervisor ,  being paid $25 per week .  :  97 In September 1867 ,  Muir undertook a walk of about 1 , 000 miles (1 , 600km) from Kentucky to Florida ,  which he recounted in his book A Thousand-Mile Walk to the Gulf .  He had no specific route chosen ,  except to go by the ""wildest ,  leafiest ,  and least trodden way I could find"" .  to the Hodgson's .  One evening in early January 1868 ,  Muir climbed onto the Hodgson house roof to watch the sunset .  He saw a ship ,  the Island Belle ,  and learned it would soon be sailing for Cuba .    John Muir died at California Hospital (now California Hospital Medical Center) "

He then studied English literature at Pembroke College ,  Cambridge .   While at Cambridge University Oddie appeared in several Footlights Club productions .  One of these ,  a revue called A Clump of Plinths ,  was so successful at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe that it was renamed Cambridge Circus and transferred to the West End in London ,  then New Zealand and Broadway in September 1964 .  Meanwhile ,  still at Cambridge ,  Oddie wrote scripts for and appeared briefly in TV's That Was the Week That Was . He appeared in Bernard Braden's television series On The Braden Beat in 1964 .  Subsequently he was a key member of the performers in the BBC radio series I'm Sorry ,  I'll Read That Again ,  where many of his musical compositions were featured .  Some were released on the album Distinctly Oddie (Polydor ,  1967) .  He was one of the first performers to parody a rock song ,  arranging the traditional Yorkshire folk song ‘On Ilkla Moor Baht'at’ in the style of Joe Cocker's hit rendition of the Beatles' ‘With a Little Help from My Friends’ (released on John Peel's Dandelion Records in 1970 and featured in Peel's special box of most-treasured singles) ,  and singing ‘Andy Pandy’ in the style of a brassy soul number such as Wilson Pickett or Geno Washington might perform .  In many shows he would do short impressions of Hughie Green . On television Oddie was co-writer and performer in the comedy series Twice a Fortnight with Graeme Garden ,  Terry Jones ,  Michael Palin and Jonathan Lynn .  Later he was co-writer and performer in the comedy series Broaden Your Mind with Tim Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden ,  for which he became a cast member for the second series .

He has occasionally appeared on the BBC Radio 4 panel game I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue ,  on which Garden is and Brooke-Taylor was a regular panellist .  In 1982 Garden and Oddie wrote ,  but did not perform in ,  a six-part science-fiction sitcom called Astronauts for Central and ITV .  The show was set in an international space station in the near future . Oddie's first published work was an article about the birdlife of Birmingham's Bartley Reservoir in the West Midland Bird Club's 1962 Annual Report) .  He has since written a number of books about birds and birdwatching as well as articles for many specialist publications including British Birds ,  Birdwatching Magazine and Birdwatch .

1075,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Rose_O%27Neill,Rose_O'Neill,Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing," Rose Cecil O'Neill was born on June 25 ,  1874 ,  in Wilkes-Barre ,  Pennsylvania .  Her parents were William Patrick Henry and Alice Cecilia Asenath Senia Smith O'Neill ""Meemie"" .  She had two younger sisters ,  Lee and Callista ,  and three younger brothers :  Hugh ,  James ,  and Clarence .  Her father was a bookseller of Irish descent who loved literature ,  art and theater .  Her mother was a gifted musician ,  actress ,  and teacher . Within two years ,  O'Neill was providing illustrations for the local Omaha publications Excelsior and The Great Divide as well as other periodicals ,  having secured this work with help from the editor at the Omaha World-Herald and the Art Director from Everybody Magazine who had judged the competition .  The income helped support her family ,  which her father had struggled to support as a bookseller .   To help foster his daughter's talents ,  O'Neill's father brought her to New York in 1893 to help begin her career ;  they stopped in Chicago en route to visit the World Columbian Exposition where she saw large paintings and sculptures for the first time .   She had only seen such work in her father's books .  O'Neill was then left to live with the Sisters of St .  Regis ,  a convent in New York City . While O'Neill was living in New York ,  her father made a homestead claim on a small tract of land in the Ozarks wilderness of southern Missouri .  The tract had a ""dog-trot"" cabin with two log cabins (one was used for eating and the other for sleeping) and a breezeway between .  A year later when O'Neill visited the land ,  it had become known as ""Bonniebrook"" . In 1892 ,  while in Omaha ,  O'Neill met a young Virginian named Gray Latham ,  whom she married in 1896 .  He visited O'Neill in New York City ,  and continued writing to her when she went to Missouri to see her family .  After Latham's father went to Mexico to make films ,  he went to Bonniebrook in 1896 .  Concerned with the welfare of her family ,  O'Neill sent much of her paycheck home . In the following years O'Neill became unhappy with Latham ,  as he liked ""living large"" and gambling ,  and was known as a playboy .  O'Neill found that Latham ,  with his very expensive tastes ,  had spent her paychecks on himself .  O'Neill then moved to Taney County ,  Missouri ,  where she filed for divorce in 1901 ,  returning to Bonniebrook .  Latham died the same year ,  and some sources state that O'Neill was widowed . In late 1901 ,  O'Neill began receiving anonymous letters and gifts in the mail . In 1904 ,  O'Neill published her first novel ,  The Loves of Edwy ,  which she also illustrated . As educational opportunities were made available in the 19th century ,  women artists became part of professional enterprises ,  and some founded their own art associations .  Artwork made by women was considered to be inferior ,  and to help overcome that stereotype women became ,  according to art historian Laura Prieto ,  ""increasingly vocal and confident"" in promoting women's work .  Many women artists ,  including O'Neill ,  could be characterized as examples of the educated ,  modern ,  and independent ""New Woman , "" a form of gender identity that emerged at the time . It was amid the New Woman and burgeoning suffragist movements that ,  in 1908 ,  O'Neill began to concentrate on producing original artwork ,  and it was during this period that she created the whimsical Kewpie characters for which she became known . In 1912 ,  J .  D .  Kestner ,  a German porcelain company ,  began the manufacturing of Kewpie dolls ,  and that year ,  O'Neill traveled to their Waltershausen plant to oversee the production of the figurines . O'Neill continued working ,  even at her wealthiest .  Perhaps driven to express herself by the unfortunate circumstances in her life ,  along with the needs of her family ,  she delved into different types of art .  She learned sculpture at the hand of Auguste Rodin and had several exhibitions of sculptures and paintings in Paris and the United States . In 1927 ,  O'Neill returned to the United States ,  and by 1937 was living at Bonniebrook permanently .  By the 1940s ,  she had lost the majority of her money and properties ,  partly through extravagant spending ,  as well as the cost of fully supporting her family ,  her entourage of ""artistic"" hangers-on ,  and her first husband .

Sunshine was also voted Australian Picture Book of the Year . Ormerod followed Sunshine with Moonlight (1982) ,  a companion book following the same child as she prepares herself for bed .  Many of Ormerod's early work concentrated on family life and in 1985 she started the Jan Ormerod Baby Book series beginning with Sleeping and Dad's Back .  These books explored the relationship between infant and father .  These were followed by the Jan Ormerod New Baby Book (1987) ,  this time focusing on a child and her pregnant mother ,  which mirrored Ormerod's own situation when she was pregnant with her second daughter ,  Laura . Despite Ormerod and Paul divorcing in 1989 ,  they remained good friends and Ormerod remained in Cambridge ,  close to her publisher Walker Books .  In the 1980s she began a close working relationship with writer David Lloyd ,  who later became the chairman of Walker ,  and in 1991 they published a retelling of The Frog Prince that she illustrated . Ormerod died of cancer on 23 January 2013 .  She was 66 and was survived by her two daughters .   "

Nevertheless ,  all three young men made a habit of deriding cultural conventions :  Pals was almost expelled from school when he burst out laughing during a lecture on poet-laureate Vasile Alecsandri . Underfunded ,  Alge only put out six or seven issues in this 1930 edition . In 1933 ,  Luca reissued Alge in a more licentious edition ,  and challenged the cultural establishment by sending a copy to Nicolae Iorga ,  the nationalist historian and political figure .  A clampdown on their activities followed :  all known contributors were caught in a police investigation ,  and Pals' home was searched for incriminating proof .  Despite no longer being a contributor (and feeling alienated by Păun and Baranga's leftist militancy) ,  Pals was implicated by his nominal editorial contribution . The writers' parents eventually obtained their release , In 1934 ,  when he and his family were naturalized Romanian , Pals graduated in 1940 ,  just as the National Renaissance Front dictatorship had barred Jews from employment in most fields ,  including technical . Pals sought full employment after the antifascist coup of 1944 ,  and ,  in 1945 ,  was dispatched to oversee the construction of railway tunnels in Cluj County . The marriage soon crumbled :  Pals was an absentee husband ,  and Valentina found it hard to cope with the rigors of life in Communist Romania . During that decade ,  the Șestopalis came into conflict with the communist regime .  In 1957 ,  an investigation began into Caraion's samizdat poetry ,  which was highly critical of the regime ,  and which Valentina had helped circulate .  At the risk of incriminating himself ,  Pals returned to his conjugal home and protected his estranged wife . In 1962 ,  Pals applied for an exit visa and emigration to Israel ,  a rebellious gesture which saw his demotion with reduced pay and his relocation to the remote town of Dej . By his own account ,  Pals lived a quiet and exceptionally fulfilling life down to 1970 :  caught up in his work during daytime ,  he turned to writing literature at night ,  and reconnected with his avant-garde friends . Pals resumed his professional career in Haifa ,  where he oversaw the digging of utility tunnels . Working from his home ,  a small apartment in Bnei Brak , Sesto Pals the poet was rediscovered in Romania only after the 1989 Revolution :  in 1998 ,  Nicolae Tzone published a book of his poetry with Editura Vinea ,  as Omul ciudat (""The Bizarre Man"") .  It was only at this time that Pals' former colleagues in the Bucharest Planning Institute discovered that he was the same as the avant-garde poet ,  as one of them confessed in a letter to the editors . Pals died in Tel Aviv ,  on October 27 ,  2002 . Much of Pals' sizable fortune was bequeathed to the Rabin Medical Center ,  founding a research unit ""for early detection and prevention of gastrointestinal cancer"" . His 2013 centennial was celebrated in Romania under the auspices of the Museum of Romanian Literature    "
1079,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Florence_Tyzack_Parbury,Florence_Tyzack_Parbury,Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing," Florence Tyzack Parbury was born in South Norwood ,  Croydon ,  Surrey on 26 September 1881 ,  the fourth child and only daughter of Douglas Stewart Parbury and Lucy Jane Tyzack .  She was baptised at Saint Luke's Woodside ,  Croydon on 2 July 1882 .   Parbury ,  the granddaughter of George Parbury ,  spent the first few years of her life in Surrey . Her parents then separated ,  and by the time Parbury was seven she and her mother had moved to Ecclesall Bierlow ,  Sheffield to live with Lucy's recently widowed mother ,  Jane Tyzack . Parbury performed in public from an early age :  in December 1889 ,  aged eight ,  she was on stage to raise funds for the Children's Hospital in Sheffield .  Her musical training began in Sheffield was with the renowned teacher Marie Foxon .  and with Jean de Reszke in Paris .  She learned to play several instruments including pianoforte ,  organ ,  violin ,  and harp ,  and also composed music . When performing for troops in World War I ,  Parbury ""Florence Parbury was interested in aviation from its early days in England .  In 1910 she attended the Blackpool Flying Carnival how she flew over Stonehenge in a biplane piloted by Howard Pixton ,  an early British aviator who won the 1914 Schneider Trophy air race held in Monaco . Parbury travelled to Egypt when she was sixteenParbury's later travels were to North America .  In 1911 ,  in Victoria ,  BC she spoke at the Women's Canadian Club ,  saying how she planned to study the country and its people ,  much as she had done in India .  After returning to England in February 1912 ,  she went back to Canada towards the end of that year .  Again in BC ,  she met Dr Charles Newcombe ,  an ethnographer with a keen interest in the indigenous peoples of the region .  After her visit ,  Parbury wrote to him several times in late 1912 and early 1913 saying that she would ""so like to reproduce a photograph of that interesting case of curios & Indian trophies & relics ,  for my book . "" While in BC Parbury also organised a trip in whichshe camped ,  climbed ,  rode on a cayuse through the Rockies ,  trekked up the Thompson River−the first white woman to be seen on its banks−with a train of five horses and six guides and packers ;  sometimes she guided her own canoe on the river ,  shooting the rapids ,  and taking all the risks of a journey in the wilds .  She reached the famous Tête Jaune Cache beyond Edmonton ,  and her book ,  illustrated by herself ,  on her Canadian experiences ,  will be published after the war .  Miss Parbury does not actually shoot big game ,  but like her friend ,  Mr .  Thompson Seton ,  she enjoys the call of the wild and the tracking of shy creatures to their lairs . The book ""Impressions of Canada"" which she was planning to publish was advertised by Macmillan's but has not so far been found . When the war broke out Parbury nursed for eight months in France with the French Red Cross .  It was probably this experience which prompted her to launch an appeal : Miss Parbury is anxious to collect a million cigarettes for our soldiers .  She will take them with her in batches and distribute them .  Without publicity up to the present ,  she has obtained 75 , 000 ,  thanks to the contributions of Sir John Thornycroft ,  Mr .  Harry Gratton ,  Mr .  Gerald du Maurier ,  Mr .  Henry Ainley ,  and others .  For 6s .  8d .  a thousand cigarettes can be obtained ,  and they are given away coupled with the names of the donors ,  and a friendly message .  Save a solicitor's letter and send our Tommies a thousand cigarettes .  Miss Parbury's address is 53 Egerton Gardens ,  S . W . Back in London ,  Parbury set up a ""Jacobean studio"" at Yeoman's Row ,  Knightsbridge where she and others would entertain wounded soldiers with sing-songs . On another occasion ,  hearing that Sir Robert Borden ,  Prime Minister of Canada ,  was in London she immediately wroteIn May 1919 ""Miss Parbury ,  author"" sailed first class to New York on the Aquitania .  She stayed in North America for two years ,  and while in New York had ""a permanent suite at the Commodore and a country house on Long Island .  in which she introduced another objective of her trip :   to establish a “League of Friendship” between England and the United States :  “If New York likes her and she likes New York ,  she will establish a clubhouse in New York and a companion house in London to further the interest of the League . ”During 1920 Parbury exhibited her paintings in the west ballroom of the Hotel Commodore on Lexington Avenue ;   flew in an escort plane from Central Park ,  Long Island to San Francisco ,  as part of the inauguration of transcontinental Pathfinder Flights ;   and stayed in Hollywood as a guest of Mr .  and Mrs .  Douglas Fairbanks .  This circuit ,  which included stops in Decatur ,  Chicago ,  Dayton and Detroit ,  gave her more opportunities to promote her League of Friendship idea ,  which she also referred to as a Friendship Club for Anglo-Saxons :  ""I want to have a beautiful clubhouse in every large city around the world where the English-speaking peoples can meet .  .  . ""In 1921 ,  Parbury  was in Washington DC ,  where she announced that she had two books coming out in the fall ,  ""Careering in Canada” and ""Atmosphering in America . ” They were to be published in practically the same form ,  with her own illustrations ,  but never appeared .  Before returning to England ,  Parbury was one of the artistes in a musicale at the home of Adolph Lewisohn ,  811 Fifth Avenue ,  for the benefit of the New York Community Service clubhouse for disabled and active service men . During her stay in the United States ,  Parbury had taken several opportunities to indulge her interest in aviation .  In July 1919 she sent a postcard to London via the British airship R34 when it left Mineola ,  NY . Back in England ,  there was another aviation adventure :  in January 1922 Parbury flew as a passenger to the Hague ,  with a Blackburn test pilot , At about this time Parbury was working on another big project .  She had in mind “a bond of harmony between the people of the Empire” mediated through an annual music festival in London .  The first British Empire Music Festival was held at the Royal Albert Hall on St .  Cecilia's Day (22 November) 1922 ,  which included patriotic music of Canada ,  four of the ""Six Australian Bush Songs"" by W .  G .  James ,  ""Rule Britannia"" and tunes from the Pipers of the Scots Guards .  The festivals continued for a few more years ,  and at the third one in 1924 Dame Clara Butt sang . Three days after the first BEMF Florence Tyzack Parbury was married at Holy Trinity Brompton to Ernest Bigland .  The ceremony was performed by Alfred William Gough ,  Prebendary of St Pauls Cathedral ,  assisted by Rev .  Canon Sir John Key ,  Bt .  ,  a cousin of the bride .  Ernest Bigland ,  some thirty years Parbury's senior ,  was a ship owner .  The bridegroom was the grandson of Sir Emil Hugo Oscar Robert Ropner ,  1st Baronet ,  ship builder and ship owner .  It was probably through the shipping connection that Mrs Bigland wrote music for this occasion . Ernest Bigland died at his home on 10 December 1942 .  Florence continued living there until about 1949 ,  after which she moved to London .  She lived her final years at Flat 11 ,  51 South Street ,  W1 ,  close to Park Lane .  She died there on 24 October 1960 ,  leaving a considerable fortune .  In her will she said ""I desire to be cremated and my ashes to be scattered by my confidential chauffeur George Upfield over the tree to be indicated by me . "" It is not known where that was .     "

1081,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Kenneth_Patchen,Kenneth_Patchen,Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing,"   Patchen's first book of poetry ,  Before the Brave ,  was published by Random House in 1936 .   His earliest collections of poetry were his most political and led to his being championed ,  in the 1930s ,  as a ""proletariat poet"" .  This description ,  which Patchen rejected ,  never stuck ,  since his work varied widely in subject ,  style and form .  As his career progressed ,  he continued to push himself into more and more experimental styles and forms ,  developing ,  along with writers such as Langston Hughes and Kenneth Rexroth ,  what came to be known as jazz poetry .  He also experimented with his childlike ""painted poems , "" many of which were published posthumously in the 1984 collection What Shall We Do Without Us . After the appearance of his first book ,  he and Miriam traveled to the Southwest and then moved to Hollywood in 1938 ,  where he tried ,  unsuccessfully ,  writing film scripts and worked for the WPA .  His next book of poems ,  First Will and Testament ,  drew the attention of James Laughlin ,  who was then launching New Directions Publishing as a student at Harvard .  Laughlin's decision to publish Patchen's work started a relationship that would last for the remainder of both men's careers .  For a short time ,  in 1939 ,  Patchen even took an office job working for New Directions .  In addition to their professional relationship ,  Patchen and Laughlin also became good friends . The lions of fireShall have their hunting in this black landTheir teeth shall tear at your soft throatsTheir claws killO the lions of fire shall awakeAnd the valleys steam with their fury…Because you have turned your faces from GodBecause you have spread your filth everywhere . Patchen pioneered the ""drawing-and-poem form"" as well as the painting-and-poem form During the course of a long and varied career ,  he also tried his hand at writing experimental novels ,  such as The Journal of Albion Moonlight and The Memoirs of a Shy Pornographer ,  and the radio play The City Wears a Slouch Hat .  Patchen's Collected Poems was first published in 1969 ,  just a few years before his death . One of Patchen's biggest literary supporters was the novelist Henry Miller ,  who wrote a long essay on Patchen ,  entitled Patchen :  Man of Anger and Light ,  in 1946 . In the 1950s ,  Patchen became a major influence on the younger beat poets ,  including Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti .  Miriam Patchen recalled some of these young poets ,  including Philip Lamantia ,  Gary Snyder ,  and Michael McClure ,  visiting the Patchens' home in San Francisco to pay their respects . In 1936 ,  soon after the release of his first book ,  Patchen was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship .  In 1944 ,  he won the Ohioana Award for his book Cloth of the Tempest .   "

1083,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Mervyn_Peake,Mervyn_Peake,Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing," Mervyn Peake was born of British parents in Kuling town located on top of Mountain Lu in Jiujiang in 1911 ,  only three months before the revolution and the founding of the Republic of China .  His father ,  Ernest Cromwell Peake ,  was a medical missionary doctor with the London Missionary Society of the Congregationalist tradition ,  and his mother ,  Amanda Elizabeth Powell ,  had come to China as a missionary assistant . The Peakes were given leave to visit England just before World War I in 1914 and returned to China in 1916 .  Mervyn Peake attended Tientsin Grammar School until the family left for England in December 1922 via the Trans-Siberian Railway .  About this time ,  he wrote a novella ,  The White Chief of the Umzimbooboo Kaffirs .  Peake never returned to China but it has been noted that Chinese influences can be detected in his works ,  not least in the castle of Gormenghast itself ,  which in some respects echoes the ancient walled city of Beijing ,  as well as the enclosed compound where he grew up in Tianjin .  It is also likely that his early exposure to the contrasts between the lives of the Europeans and of the Chinese ,  and between the poor and the wealthy in China ,  also exerted an influence on the Gormenghast books . His education continued at Eltham College ,  Mottingham (1923–29) ,  where his talents were encouraged by his English teacher ,  Eric Drake .  Peake completed his formal education at Croydon School of Art in the autumn of 1929 and then from December 1929 to 1933 at the Royal Academy Schools ,  where he first painted in oils .  By this time he had written his first long poem ,  A Touch o' the Ash .  In 1931 he had a painting accepted for display by the Royal Academy and exhibited his work with the so-called ""Soho Group"" .   His early career in the 1930s was as a painter in London ,  although he lived on the Channel Island of Sark for a time .  He first moved to Sark in 1932 where his former teacher Eric Drake was setting up an artists' colony .  In 1934 Peake exhibited with the Sark artists both in the Sark Gallery built by Drake and at the Cooling Galleries in London ,  and in 1935 he exhibited at the Royal Academy and at the Leger Galleries in London . In 1936 he returned to London and was commissioned to design the sets and costumes for The Insect Play and his work was acclaimed in The Sunday Times .  He also began teaching life drawing at Westminster School of Art where he met the painter Maeve Gilmore ,  whom he married in 1937 .  They had three children ,  Sebastian (1940–2012) ,  Fabian (b .  1942) ,  and Clare (b .  1949) . He had a very successful exhibition of paintings at the Calmann Gallery in London in 1938 and his first book ,  the self-illustrated children's pirate romance Captain Slaughterboard Drops Anchor (based on a story he had written around 1936) was first published in 1939 by Country Life .  In December 1939 he was commissioned by Chatto & Windus to illustrate a children's book ,  Ride a Cock Horse and Other Nursery Rhymes ,  published for the Christmas market in 1940 . At the outbreak of World War II he applied to become a war artist for he was keen to put his skills at the service of his country .  He imagined An Exhibition by the Artist ,  Adolf Hitler ,  in which horrific images of war with ironic titles were offered as ""artworks"" by the Nazi leader .  Although the drawings were bought by the British Ministry of Information ,  Peake's application was turned down and he was conscripted into the Army ,  where he served first with the Royal Artillery ,  then with the Royal Engineers .  He began writing Titus Groan at this time . In April 1942 ,  after his requests for commissions as a war artist– or even leave to depict war damage in London– had been consistently refused ,  he suffered a nervous breakdown and was sent to Southport Hospital .  That autumn he was taken on as a graphic artist by the Ministry of Information for a period of six months to work on propaganda illustrations .  The next spring he was invalided out of the Army .  In 1943 he was commissioned by the War Artists' Advisory Committee ,  WAAC ,  to paint glassblowers at the Chance Brothers factory in Smethwick where cathode ray tubes for early radar sets were being produced . The five years between 1943 and 1948 were some of the most productive of his career .  He finished Titus Groan and Gormenghast and completed some of his most acclaimed illustrations for books by other authors ,  including Lewis Carroll's The Hunting of the Snark (for which he was reportedly paid only £5) and Alice in Wonderland ,  Samuel Taylor Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner ,  the Brothers Grimm's Household Tales ,  All This and Bevin Too by Quentin Crisp and Robert Louis Stevenson's Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde ,  as well as producing many original poems ,  drawings ,  and paintings . Peake designed the logo for Pan Books .  The publishers offered him either a flat fee of £10 or a royalty of one farthing per book .  On the advice of Graham Greene ,  who told him that paperback books were a passing fad that would not last ,  Peake opted for the £10 . A book of nonsense poems ,  Rhymes Without Reason ,  was published in 1944 and was described by John Betjeman as ""outstanding"" .  Shortly after the war ended in 1945 ,  Edgar Ainsworth ,  the art editor of Picture Post ,  commissioned Peake to visit France and Germany for the magazine . In 1946 the family moved to Sark ,  where Peake continued to write and illustrate ,  and Maeve painted .   Gormenghast was published in 1950 ,  Mr Pye was published in 1953 ,  and he later adapted it as a radio play .  The BBC broadcast other plays of his in 1954 and 1956 .  Throughout the 1960s ,  Peake's health declined into physical and mental incapacitation ,  and he died on 17 November 1968 at a care home run by his brother-in-law ,  at Burcot ,  near Oxford .  He was buried in the churchyard of St Mary's in the village of Burpham ,  Sussex . A 2003 study published in JAMA Neurology assessed that Peake's death was the result of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) . His work ,  especially the Gormenghast series ,  became much better known and more widely appreciated after his death .  They have since been translated into more than two dozen languages .  "

He subsequently wrote and illustrated a sequel :  Jack and Alice :  Where Are The Cats?As part of Themo's academic development ,  he wrote and illustrated his first children's book ,  Unexplained Phenomena (and Various Excuses Why) containing a variety of children's poems .  The theme of his first anthology dealt with explanations for the bizarre occurrences in childhood .  Shortly following this he illustrated a book ,  Kroll and Peel’s Illustrated Guide to Infectious Diseases for Young People who are Especially Curious .  This was completed in partnership with David Kroll ,  MD ;  it was tongue-in-cheek guide for children about the world of diseases with illustrations of the various bacteria ,  viruses and parasites .  His first young-adult novel ,  Black Star ,  was published in October 2013 and featured his own illustrations and designs .  A percentage of the sales of the book were donated to Book Aid International ,  a charity that increases access to books and supports literacy ,  education and development in Sub-Saharan Africa .   "
1085,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Bill_Peet,Bill_Peet,Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing," Bill Peet was born in Grandview ,  Indiana ,  on January 29 ,  1915 .  He developed a love of drawing at an early age and filled tablets with sketches . According to his autobiography ,  Peet's happiest childhood times were the years following World War I - years during which his father abandoned the family .   During that period Peet lived with his mother and brothers on the outskirts of Indianapolis ,  in a household run by his maternal grandmother . Animals were always a love of Peet's .  He and his friends traipsed through the woods looking for frogs ,  tadpoles ,  and minnows .  Most of his adventures as a boy to catch animals were in the hope that he could capture them and sketch them .   These years laid the groundwork for two primary themes repeated in his books :  unkindness in the animal kingdom and the grim costs of human progress .   ""It has always been difficult for me to accept nature's cruel ways of keeping a balance among the animals - all the savagery and suffering , "" he wrote about the frogs and snakes he chased in his local creek .   ""Yet nature's merciless ways were never more cruel than the slow ,  silent death caused by the poisonous waste spilling from pipes down into the creek .  .  .  where dead fish floated belly up and a nauseating stench filled the air . ""Often ,  instead of doing lessons ,  Peet drew in the margins of his textbooks ,  which were very popular for their added illustrations when he sold them back . The young Peet also snuck into greeting parties at the train station ,  just for the chance to see the train's mechanical workings close-up .   As a teen ,  he tried to sketch the circus big top ,  but he was always in the way of the set-up crew .  He memorized the scene and later reconstructed it from memory . After ten years of absence ,  Peet's father returned to the household and ,  according to Peet ,  brought with him conflict and strife - demanding that Peet's mother provide money to underwrite a string of failed ventures as a traveling salesman .   This chapter culminated in the death of Peet's grandmother ,  which Peet implied was in part caused by the stress and misery his father caused .   The home where the family lived was sold ,  and Peet's blissful young years ended . It was about this time Peet entered into Arsenal Technical High School .  At first ,  he had little interest in pursuing a career as an artist .  However ,  after failing all his classes but physical education ,  he followed the advice of a friend and took some art classes .  Peet did extremely well and experimented with a broad range of media .  He eventually received a scholarship to the John Herron Art Institute in Indianapolis ,  which he attended for three years .  In the first class ,  Bill found himself very interested in a girl who sat in the front row .  That girl ,  Margaret Brunst ,  became his wife in 1937 . Peet took quite a few painting classes that first year ,  and he admitted his paintings were always somewhat macabre .  ""I seemed to be attracted to the gloomy side of things ,  or the sordid , "" he wrote .  ""No vases of flowers or water lilies for me . "" His favorite subjects were grizzled old men ,  “perfected with age ,  like a gnarled oak tree . ” Another favorite subject was the circus—but always the assembly of the tent cities ,  never the show itself .

1090,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Beatrix_Potter,Beatrix_Potter,Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing," Potter's family on both sides were from the Manchester area . Potter's father ,  Rupert William Potter (1832–1914) ,  was educated at Manchester College by the Unitarian philosopher James Martineau . Potter's parents lived comfortably at 2 Bolton Gardens ,  West Brompton ,  where Helen Beatrix was born on 28 July 1866 and her brother Walter Bertram on 14 March 1872 . Beatrix Potter was educated by three governesses ,  the last of whom was Annie Moore (née Carter) ,  just three years older than Potter ,  who tutored Potter in German as well as acting as lady's companion . She and her younger brother Walter Bertram (1872–1918) grew up with few friends outside their large extended family .  Her parents were artistic ,  interested in nature ,  and enjoyed the countryside .  As children ,  Potter and Bertram had numerous small animals as pets which they observed closely and drew endlessly .  In their schoolroom ,  Potter and Bertram kept a variety of small pets—mice ,  rabbits ,  a hedgehog and some bats ,  along with collections of butterflies and other insects—which they drew and studied . At about the age of 14 ,  Potter began to keep a diary .  It was written in a code of her own devising which was a simple letter for letter substitution .  Her Journal was important to the development of her creativity ,  serving as both sketchbook and literary experiment :  in tiny handwriting ,  she reported on society ,  recorded her impressions of art and artists ,  recounted stories and observed life around her .  and managing their various households . Beatrix Potter's parents did not discourage higher education .  As was common in the Victorian era ,  women of her class were privately educated and rarely went to university . Beatrix Potter was interested in every branch of natural science save astronomy . Rebuffed by William Thiselton-Dyer ,  the Director at Kew ,  because of her sex and her amateur status ,  Potter wrote up her conclusions and submitted a paper ,  On the Germination of the Spores of the Agaricineae ,  to the Linnean Society in 1897 .  It was introduced by Massee because ,  as a female ,  Potter could not attend proceedings or read her paper .  She subsequently withdrew it ,  realising that some of her samples were contaminated ,  but continued her microscopic studies for several more years .  Her paper has only recently been rediscovered ,  along with the rich ,  artistic illustrations and drawings that accompanied it .  Her work is only now being properly evaluated . Potter's artistic and literary interests were deeply influenced by fairy tales and fantasy .  She was a student of the classic fairy tales of Western Europe .  As well as stories from the Old Testament ,  John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress and Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin ,  she grew up with Aesop's Fables ,  the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen ,  Charles Kingsley's The Water Babies , In her teenage years ,  Potter was a regular visitor to the art galleries of London ,  particularly enjoying the summer and winter exhibitions at the Royal Academy in London . As a way to earn money in the 1890s ,  Potter and her brother began to print Christmas cards of their own design ,  as well as cards for special occasions .  Mice and rabbits were the most frequent subject of her fantasy paintings .  In 1890 ,  the firm of Hildesheimer and Faulkner bought several of the drawings of her rabbit Benjamin Bunny to illustrate verses by Frederic Weatherly titled A Happy Pair .  In 1893 ,  the same printer bought several more drawings for Weatherly's Our Dear Relations ,  another book of rhymes ,  and the following year Potter sold a series of frog illustrations and verses for Changing Pictures ,  a popular annual offered by the art publisher Ernest Nister .  Potter was pleased by this success and determined to publish her own illustrated stories . Whenever Potter went on holiday to the Lake District or Scotland ,  she sent letters to young friends ,  illustrating them with quick sketches .  Many of these letters were written to the children of her former governess Annie Carter Moore ,  particularly to Moore's eldest son Noel ,  who was often ill .  In September 1893 ,  Potter was on holiday at Eastwood in Dunkeld ,  Perthshire .  She had run out of things to say to Noel ,  and so she told him a story about ""four little rabbits whose names were Flopsy ,  Mopsy ,  Cottontail and Peter"" .  It became one of the most famous children's letters ever written and the basis of Potter's future career as a writer-artist-storyteller . In 1900 ,  Potter revised her tale about the four little rabbits ,  and fashioned a dummy book of it – it has been suggested ,  in imitation of Helen Bannerman's 1899 bestseller The Story of Little Black Sambo . On 2 October 1902 ,  The Tale of Peter Rabbit was published , The immense popularity of Potter's books was based on the lively quality of her illustrations ,  the non-didactic nature of her stories ,  the depiction of the rural countryside ,  and the imaginative qualities she lent to her animal characters . Potter was also a canny businesswoman .  As early as 1903 ,  she made and patented a Peter Rabbit doll .  It was followed by other ""spin-off"" merchandise over the years ,  including painting books ,  board games ,  wall-paper ,  figurines ,  baby blankets and china tea-sets .  All were licensed by Frederick Warne & Co and earned Potter an independent income ,  as well as immense profits for her publisher . In 1905 ,  Potter and Norman Warne became unofficially engaged .  Potter's parents objected to the match because Warne was ""in trade"" and thus not socially suitable .  The engagement lasted only one month—Warne died of pernicious anaemia at age 37 . The tenant farmer John Cannon and his family agreed to stay on to manage the farm for her while she made physical improvements and learned the techniques of fell farming and of raising livestock ,  including pigs ,  cows and chickens ;  the following year she added sheep .  Realising she needed to protect her boundaries ,  she sought advice from W . H .  Heelis & Son ,  a local firm of solicitors with offices in nearby Hawkshead .  With William Heelis acting for her ,  she bought contiguous pasture ,  and in 1909 the 20 acres (8 . 1ha) Castle Farm across the road from Hill Top Farm .  She visited Hill Top at every opportunity ,  and her books written during this period (such as The Tale of Ginger and Pickles ,  about the local shop in Near Sawrey and The Tale of Mrs .  Tittlemouse ,  a wood mouse) reflect her increasing participation in village life and her delight in country living . Owning and managing these working farms required routine collaboration with the widely respected William Heelis .  By the summer of 1912 ,  Heelis had proposed marriage and Potter had accepted ;  although she did not immediately tell her parents ,  who once again disapproved because Heelis was only a country solicitor .  Potter and Heelis were married on 15 October 1913 in London at St Mary Abbots in Kensington .  The couple moved immediately to Near Sawrey ,  residing at Castle Cottage ,  the renovated farmhouse on Castle Farm ,  which was 34 acres large .  Hill Top remained a working farm but was now remodelled to allow for the tenant family and Potter's private studio and workshop .  At last her own woman ,  Potter settled into the partnerships that shaped the rest of her life :  her country solicitor husband and his large family ,  her farms ,  the Sawrey community and the predictable rounds of country life .  The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck and The Tale of Tom Kitten are representative of Hill Top Farm and her farming life and reflect her happiness with her country life . Rupert Potter died in 1914 and ,  with the outbreak of World War I ,  Potter ,  now a wealthy woman ,  persuaded her mother to move to the Lake District and found a property for her to rent in Sawrey .  Finding life in Sawrey dull ,  Helen Potter soon moved to Lindeth Howe (now a 34 bedroomed hotel) a large house the Potters had previously rented for the summer in Bowness ,  on the other side of Lake Windermere , Soon after acquiring Hill Top Farm ,  Potter became keenly interested in the breeding and raising of Herdwick sheep ,  the indigenous fell sheep .  In 1923 she bought a large sheep farm in the Troutbeck Valley called Troutbeck Park Farm ,  formerly a deer park ,  restoring its land with thousands of Herdwick sheep .  This established her as one of the major Herdwick sheep farmers in the county .  She was admired by her shepherds and farm managers for her willingness to experiment with the latest biological remedies for the common diseases of sheep ,  and for her employment of the best shepherds ,  sheep breeders ,  and farm managers . By the late 1920s ,  Potter and her Hill Top farm manager Tom Storey had made a name for their prize-winning Herdwick flock ,  which took many prizes at the local agricultural shows ,  where Potter was often asked to serve as a judge .  In 1942 she became President-elect of the Herdwick Sheepbreeders' Association ,  the first time a woman had been elected but died before taking office .     "

His ancestors immigrated to New York from the Netherlands during the 17th century .   His father ,  Roy ,  worked as an engineer ;  his mother ,  Virginia (Arbogast) ,  was employed as a secretary .   He was raised in Phoenix ,  Arizona .   His father died in a traffic collision several days before Christmas while on a business trip when Quackenbush was nine years old .   The two feuded over an insignificant matter before his trip and Quackenbush assumed that it was related to his father's death .   He went to a therapist to help alleviate his anguish and this consequently piqued his long-lasting interest in children’s therapy and mental health . After graduating from high school in 1947 ,  Quackenbush spent a summer studying art at Parsons School of Design .   He initially attended Phoenix College ,  but opted not to continue his studies and worked towards a career in art instead .   He subsequently enrolled in the ArtCenter College of Design in 1948 .   Two years later ,  he was chosen in the Selective Service draft and joined the US Army to fight in the Korean War .   He was stationed in South Carolina and Indiana ,  where he continued his art by painting watercolor portraits of his fellow soldiers and officers .   Quackenbush was honorably discharged in 1953 ,  with his G . I .  Bill helping him finish his studies at the ArtCenter .   Quackenbush first worked as creative director for Scandinavian Airlines . Quackenbush authored and illustrated over 200 books .   He created the characters Detective Mole ,  Miss Mallard ,  and Pete Pack Rat . During his 60s ,  Quackenbush returned to school ,  obtaining a master's degree in social work from Fordham University .   "

1095,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Arthur_Ransome,Arthur_Ransome,Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing," Ransome was the son of Cyril Ransome (1851–1897) and his wife Edith Ransome (née Baker Boulton) (1862–1944) .  Joyce married into the Lupton family ,  well-connected industrialists and politicians ;  she named one of her sons Arthur Ralph Ransome Lupton . Ransome was born in Leeds ;  Ransome's father was professor of history at Yorkshire College (now the University of Leeds) .  The family regularly holidayed at Nibthwaite in the Lake District ,  and he was carried up to the top of Coniston Old Man as an infant .  His father's premature death in 1897 had a lasting effect on him .  His mother did not want him to abandon his studies for writing ,  but was later supportive of his books .  She urged him to publish The Picts and the Martyrs in 1943 ,  although his second wife Evgenia hated it ;  Genia was often discouraging about his books while he was writing them . Ransome was educated first in Windermere and then at Rugby School (where he lived in the same study room that had been used by Lewis Carroll) but did not entirely enjoy the experience ,  because of his poor eyesight ,  lack of athletic skill ,  and limited academic achievement .  He studied chemistry at Yorkshire College ,  where his late father had worked .    Ransome died in Cheadle Royal Hospital in 1967 .  He and his wife Evgenia are buried in the churchyard of St Paul's Church ,  Rusland ,  Cumbria ,  in the southern Lake District .  The Autobiography of Arthur Ransome ,  edited by Rupert Hart-Davis ,  was published posthumously in 1976 .  It covers his life only to the completion of Peter Duck in 1931 .  "
1096,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Satyajit_Ray,Satyajit_Ray,Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing,"   After being ""deeply moved"" by Pather Panchali , Ray gathered an inexperienced crew ,  although both his cameraman Subrata Mitra and art director Bansi Chandragupta went on to achieve great acclaim .  The cast consisted of mostly amateur actors .  After unsuccessful attempts to persuade many producers to finance the project ,  Ray started shooting in late 1952 with his personal savings and hoped to raise more money once he had some footage shot ,  but did not succeed on his terms . With a loan from the West Bengal government ,  Ray finally completed the film ;  it was released in 1955 to critical acclaim .  It earned numerous awards and had long theatrical runs in India and abroad .  The Times of India wrote ""It is absurd to compare it with any other Indian cinema Ray's international career started in earnest after the success of his next film ,  the second in The Apu Trilogy ,  Aparajito (1956) (The Unvanquished) . While making Aparajito ,  Ray had not planned a trilogy ,  but after he was asked about the idea in Venice ,  it appealed to him . Despite Ray's success ,  it had little influence on his personal life in the years to come .  He continued to live with his wife and children in a rented house ,  with his mother ,  uncle and other members of his extended family . During this period ,  Ray made films about the British Raj period ,  a documentary on Tagore ,  a comic film (Mahapurush) and his first film from an original screenplay ('Kanchenjungha') .  He also made a series of films that ,  taken together ,  are considered by critics among the most deeply felt portrayals of Indian women on screen . Ray followed Apur Sansar with 1960's Devi (The Goddess) ,  a film in which he examined the superstitions in Hindu society .  Sharmila Tagore starred as Doyamoyee ,  a young wife who is deified by her father-in-law .  Ray was worried that the Central Board of Film Certification might block his film ,  or at least make him re-cut it ,  but Devi was spared .  Upon international distribution ,  the critic from Chicago Reader described the film as ""full of sensuality and ironic undertones"" . In the same year ,  together with Subhas Mukhopadhyay and others ,  Ray was able to revive Sandesh ,  the children's magazine which his grandfather had founded . In 1962 ,  Ray directed Kanchenjungha ,  Based on his first original screenplay ,  it was also his first colour film .  It tells the story of an upper-class family spending an afternoon in Darjeeling ,  a picturesque hill town in West Bengal .  They try to arrange the engagement of their youngest daughter to a highly paid engineer educated in London .  Ray had first conceived shooting the film in a large mansion ,  but later decided to film it in the famous town .  He used many shades of light and mist to reflect the tension in the drama .  Ray noted that while his script allowed shooting to be possible under any lighting conditions ,  a commercial film crew in Darjeeling failed to shoot a single scene ,  as they only wanted to do so in sunshine . In 1964 ,  Ray directed Charulata (The Lonely Wife) ;  one of Ray's favourite films ,  it was regarded by many critics as his most accomplished . In the post-Charulata period ,  Ray took on various projects ,  from fantasy ,  science fiction ,  detective to historical dramas .  Ray also experimented during this period .  He explored contemporary issues of Indian life ,  responding to a perceived lack of these issues in his films .  The first major film in this period is 1966's Nayak (The Hero) ,  the story of a screen hero travelling in a train and meeting a young ,  sympathetic female journalist .  Starring Uttam Kumar and Sharmila Tagore ,  in the twenty-four hours of the journey ,  the film explores the inner conflict of the apparently highly successful matinée idol .  Although the film received a ""Critics Prize"" at the Berlin International Film Festival ,  it had a generally muted reception . In 1967 ,  Ray wrote a script for a film to be called The Alien ,  based on his short story ""Bankubabur Bandhu"" (""Banku Babu's Friend"") ,  which he wrote in 1962 for Sandesh magazine .  It was planned to be a U . S .  and India co-production with Columbia Pictures ,  with Marlon Brando and Peter Sellers cast in the leading roles .  Ray found that his script had been copyrighted and the fee appropriated by Michael Wilson .  Wilson had initially approached Ray through their mutual friend ,  Arthur C .  Clarke ,  to represent him in Hollywood .  Wilson copyrighted the script credited to Mike Wilson & Satyajit Ray ,  although he contributed only one word .  Ray later said that he never received compensation for the script .  Columbia attempted to revive the project ,  without success ,  in the 1970s and 1980s .  In 1969 ,  Ray directed one of his most commercially successful films ;  a musical fantasy based on a children's story written by his grandfather ,  Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne (The Adventures of Goopy and Bagha) . Next ,  Ray directed the film adaptation of a novel by the poet and writer ,  Sunil Gangopadhyay .  Featuring a musical motif structure acclaimed as more complex than Charulata , After Aranyer Din Ratri ,  Ray addressed contemporary Bengali life .  He completed what became known as the Calcutta trilogy :  Pratidwandi (1970) ,  Seemabaddha (1971) ,  and Jana Aranya (1975) ,  three films that were conceived separately but had similar themes . Ray considered making a film on the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War but later abandoned the idea ,  saying that ,  as a filmmaker ,  he was more interested in the travails of the refugees and not the politics . In 1980 ,  Ray made a sequel to Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne ,  a somewhat political Hirak Rajar Deshe (Kingdom of Diamonds) .  The kingdom of the evil Diamond King ,  or Hirok Raj ,  is an allusion to India during Indira Gandhi's emergency period . In 1983 ,  while working on Ghare Baire (Home and the World) ,  Ray suffered a heart attack ;  it would severely limit his productivity in the remaining 9 years of his life .  Ghare Baire ,  an adaptation of the novel of the same name ,  was completed in 1984 with the help of Ray's son ,  who served as a camera operator from then-onward .  It is about the dangers of fervent nationalism ;  he wrote the first draft of a script for it in the 1940s .  It also featured the first kiss scene portrayed in Ray's films . In 1987 ,  Ray recovered to an extent to direct the 1990 film Shakha Proshakha (Branches of the Tree) . A heavy-smoker but non-drinker ;  Ray valued work more than anything else .  He would work 12 hours a day ,  and go to bed at two o'clock in the morning .  He also enjoyed collecting antiques ,  manuscripts ,  rare gramophone records ,  paintings and rare books .   "

Set in the fictional world known as ""The Edge"" ,  the books have been praised for Chris's beautifully detailed line drawings and the unique nature of their collaborative writing process . For his illustrations ,  Riddell was a commended runner-up for the 1994 Kate Greenaway Medal (Something Else by Kathryn Cave) and highly commended for 1999 (Castle Diary by Richard Platt) . He won the 2001 Medal for illustrating Pirate Diary :  The Journal of Jake Carpenter by Platt .  (After Castle Diary and Pirate Diary ,  Platt continued the Diary series with illustrator David Parkins . )Three years later ,  Riddell won the Greenaway again ,  this time for his work on Jonathan Swift's ""Gulliver"" (Walker ,  2004) ,  retold by Martin Jenkins from the 1726 classic Gulliver's Travels . (The 2001 and 2004 panels recommended Pirate Diary and Gulliver for readers age 8+ and 10+ ,  while their recommendations for thirteen other shortlisted books ranged from 2+ to 7+ . )Other books illustrated by Chris Riddell include Fergus Crane ,  Corby Flood ,  and Hugo Pepper ,  all set in the same world .  These books were also co-written with Paul Stewart .  Stewart and Riddell also collaborated with him on Muddle Earth and the Barnaby Grimes series .  Most recently ,  Riddell has both written and illustrated the Ottoline series ,  written while he was on holiday visiting his brother in Malaysia .  The first book ,  Ottoline and the Yellow Cat (2007) ,  won the final Smarties Prize in age category 6–8 years (the Smarties were discontinued in 2008) .  It has been followed by Ottoline Goes to School and Ottoline at Sea . Beside writing and illustrating books ,  Riddell is an acclaimed political cartoonist for the Observer newspaper in London ,  where his caricatures of politicians from John Major to Gordon Brown ,  Bill Clinton to George W .  Bush ,  have earned him a reputation as a fine draughtsman and acute commentator on the political scene .  Before working at the Observer ,  Chris spent time working at the Economist as an illustrator and occasional cover artist . Chris Riddell is the cover artist for the Literary Review magazine formerly edited by Auberon Waugh ,  a role he took over from the late Willie Rushton .  Chris's serial gag cartoon for this magazine ,  called ""Illustration to Unwritten Books"" ,  was published in book form as The Da Vinci Cod and Other Illustrations to Unwritten Books . In November 2017 ,  Riddell publicly accused department store chain John Lewis of plagiarizing elements of his 1986 picture book Mr Underbed for their Christmas advert ""Moz the Monster"" .  The chain defended the allegations ,  noting that the concept of a monster who lived under a child's bed was a common literary trope ,  and that both works had dissimilar plots .  The row led to renewed interest in the book ,  with copies quickly selling out from stores .   "

1106,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Rudyard_Kipling,Rudyard_Kipling,Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing,"    Kipling kept writing until the early 1930s ,  but at a slower pace and with less success than before .  On the night of 12 January 1936 ,  he suffered a haemorrhage in his small intestine .  He underwent surgery ,  but died at Middlesex Hospital less than a week later on 18 January 1936 ,  at the age of 70 ,  of a perforated duodenal ulcer . The pallbearers at the funeral included Kipling's cousin ,  Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin ,  and the marble casket was covered by a Union Jack . In 2010 ,  the International Astronomical Union approved the naming of a crater on the planet Mercury after Kipling – one of ten newly discovered impact craters observed by the MESSENGER spacecraft in 2008–2009 . More than 50 unpublished poems by Kipling ,  discovered by the American scholar Thomas Pinney ,  were released for the first time in March 2013 . Kipling's writing has strongly influenced that of others .  His stories for adults remain in print and have garnered high praise from writers as different as Poul Anderson ,  Jorge Luis Borges ,  and Randall Jarrell ,  who wrote :  ""After you have read Kipling's fifty or seventy-five best stories you realize that few men have written this many stories of this much merit ,  and that very few have written more and better stories . ""His children's stories remain popular and his Jungle Books made into several films .  The first was made by producer Alexander Korda .  Other films have been produced by The Walt Disney Company .  A number of his poems were set to music by Percy Grainger .  A series of short films based on some of his stories was broadcast by the BBC in 1964 .  Kipling's work is still popular today . The poet T .  S .  Eliot edited A Choice of Kipling's Verse (1941) with an introductory essay .  Eliot finds instead : An immense gift for using words ,  an amazing curiosity and power of observation with his mind and with all his senses ,  the mask of the entertainer ,  and beyond that a queer gift of second sight ,  of transmitting messages from elsewhere ,  a gift so disconcerting when we are made aware of it that thenceforth we are never sure when it is not present :  all this makes Kipling a writer impossible wholly to understand and quite impossible to belittle . Of Kipling's verse ,  such as his Barrack-Room Ballads ,  Eliot writes ""of a number of poets who have written great poetry ,  only .  .  .  a very few whom I should call great verse writers .  And unless I am mistaken ,  Kipling's position in this class is not only high ,  but unique . ""In response to Eliot ,  George Orwell wrote a long consideration of Kipling's work for Horizon in 1942 ,  noting that although as a ""jingo imperialist"" Kipling was ""morally insensitive and aesthetically disgusting"" ,  his work had many qualities which ensured that while ""every enlightened person has despised him .  .  .  nine-tenths of those enlightened persons are forgotten and Kipling is in some sense still there . "" : One reason for Kipling's power  his sense of responsibility ,  which made it possible for him to have a world-view ,  even though it happened to be a false one .  Although he had no direct connexion with any political party ,  Kipling was a Conservative ,  a thing that does not exist nowadays .  Those who now call themselves Conservatives are either Liberals ,  Fascists or the accomplices of Fascists .  He identified himself with the ruling power and not with the opposition .  In a gifted writer this seems to us strange and even disgusting ,  but it did have the advantage of giving Kipling a certain grip on reality .  The ruling power is always faced with the question ,  'In such and such circumstances ,  what would you do?' ,  whereas the opposition is not obliged to take responsibility or make any real decisions .  Where it is a permanent and pensioned opposition ,  as in England ,  the quality of its thought deteriorates accordingly .  Moreover ,  anyone who starts out with a pessimistic ,  reactionary view of life tends to be justified by events ,  for Utopia never arrives and 'the gods of the copybook headings' ,  as Kipling himself put it ,  always return .  Kipling sold out to the British governing class ,  not financially but emotionally .  This warped his political judgement ,  for the British ruling class were not what he imagined ,  and it led him into abysses of folly and snobbery ,  but he gained a corresponding advantage from having at least tried to imagine what action and responsibility are like .  It is a great thing in his favour that he is not witty ,  not 'daring' ,  has no wish to épater les bourgeois .  He dealt largely in platitudes ,  and since we live in a world of platitudes ,  much of what he said sticks .  Even his worst follies seem less shallow and less irritating than the 'enlightened' utterances of the same period ,  such as Wilde's epigrams or the collection of cracker-mottoes at the end of Man and Superman . In 1939 ,  the poet W . H .  Auden celebrated Kipling in a similarly ambiguous way in his elegy for William Butler Yeats .  Auden deleted this section from more recent editions of his poems . Time ,  that is intolerantOf the brave and innocent , And indifferent in a weekTo a beautiful physique , Worships language ,  and forgivesEveryone by whom it lives ; Pardons cowardice ,  conceit , Lays its honours at his feet . Time ,  that with this strange excuse , Pardons Kipling and his views , And will pardon Paul Claudel , Pardons him for writing well . The poet Alison Brackenbury writes ""Kipling is poetry's Dickens ,  an outsider and journalist with an unrivalled ear for sound and speech . ""The English folk singer Peter Bellamy was a lover of Kipling's poetry ,  much of which he believed to have been influenced by English traditional folk forms .  He recorded several albums of Kipling's verse set to traditional airs ,  or to tunes of his own composition written in traditional style . Kipling often is quoted in discussions of contemporary British political and social issues .  In 1911 ,  Kipling wrote the poem ""The Reeds of Runnymede"" that celebrated the Magna Carta ,  and summoned up a vision of the ""stubborn Englishry"" determined to defend their rights .  In 1996 ,  the following verses of the poem were quoted by former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher warning against the encroachment of the European Union on national sovereignty : At Runnymede ,  at Runnymede , Oh ,  hear the reeds at Runnymede : 'You musn't sell ,  delay ,  deny , A freeman's right or liberty . It wakes the stubborn Englishry , We saw 'em roused at Runnymede! .  .  .  And still when Mob or Monarch laysToo rude a hand on English ways , The whisper wakes ,  the shudder plays , Across the reeds at Runnymede . And Thames ,  that knows the mood of kings , And crowds and priests and suchlike things , Rolls deep and dreadful as he bringsTheir warning down from Runnymede!Political singer-songwriter Billy Bragg ,  who attempts to build a left-wing English nationalism in contrast with the more common right-wing English nationalism ,  has attempted to 'reclaim' Kipling for an inclusive sense of Englishness . In 1903 ,  Kipling gave permission to Elizabeth Ford Holt to borrow themes from the Jungle Books to establish Camp Mowglis ,  a summer camp for boys on the shores of Newfound Lake in New Hampshire .  Throughout their lives ,  Kipling and his wife Carrie maintained an active interest in Camp Mowglis ,  which still continues the traditions that Kipling inspired .  Buildings at Mowglis have names such as Akela ,  Toomai ,  Baloo ,  and Panther .  The campers are referred to as ""the Pack"" ,  from the youngest ""Cubs"" to the oldest living in ""Den"" . Kipling's links with the Scouting movements were also strong .  Robert Baden-Powell ,  founder of Scouting ,  used many themes from Jungle Book stories and Kim in setting up his junior Wolf Cubs .  These ties still exist ,  such as the popularity of ""Kim's Game"" .  The movement is named after Mowgli's adopted wolf family ,  and adult helpers of Wolf Cub Packs take names from The Jungle Book ,  especially the adult leader called Akela after the leader of the Seeonee wolf pack . After the death of Kipling's wife in 1939 ,  his house ,  Bateman's in Burwash ,  East Sussex ,  where he had lived from 1902 until 1936 ,  was bequeathed to the National Trust .  It is now a public museum dedicated to the author .  Elsie Bambridge ,  his only child who lived to maturity ,  died childless in 1976 ,  and bequeathed her copyrights to the National Trust ,  which in turn donated them to the University of Sussex to ensure better public access . Novelist and poet Sir Kingsley Amis wrote a poem ,  ""Kipling at Bateman's"" ,  after visiting Burwash (where Amis's father lived briefly in the 1960s) as part of a BBC television series on writers and their houses . In 2003 ,  actor Ralph Fiennes read excerpts from Kipling's works from the study in Bateman's ,  including The Jungle Book ,  Something of Myself ,  Kim ,  and The Just So Stories ,  and poems ,  including ""If  .  .  . "" and ""My Boy Jack"" ,  for a CD published by the National Trust . In modern-day India ,  whence he drew much of his material ,  Kipling's reputation remains controversial ,  especially among modern nationalists and some post-colonial critics .  It has long been alleged that Rudyard Kipling was a prominent supporter of Colonel Reginald Dyer ,  who was responsible for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar (in the province of Punjab) ,  and that Kipling called Dyer ""the man who saved India"" and initiated collections for the latter's homecoming prize . Many contemporary Indian intellectuals such as Ashis Nandy have a nuanced view of Kipling's legacy .  Jawaharlal Nehru ,  the first prime minister of independent India ,  often described Kipling's novel Kim as one of his favourite books . G . V .  Desani ,  an Indian writer of fiction ,  had a more negative opinion of Kipling .  He alludes to Kipling in his novel All About H .  Hatterr : I happen to pick up R .  Kipling's autobiographical Kim . Therein ,  this self-appointed whiteman's burden-bearing sherpa feller's stated how ,  in the Orient ,  blokes hit the road and think nothing of walking a thousand miles in search of something . Indian writer Khushwant Singh wrote in 2001 that he considers Kipling's ""If—"" ""the essence of the message of The Gita in English"" ,  In November 2007 ,  it was announced that Kipling's birth home in the campus of the J .  J .  School of Art in Bombay would be turned into a museum celebrating the author and his works .  "

1111,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Richard_Scarry,Richard_Scarry,Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing,"   After entering the Army ,  Scarry was assigned to the military's radio repair school .  After a small success in that trade ,  he was chosen to paint a large sign and then made an art director after receiving a medical dispensation ""from strenuous physical activity"" .  Later he became ""Editor and Writer of Publications for the Information and Morale Services Section of the Allied Force Headquarters"" ,  served in North Africa ,  and was discharged from the Army in 1946 . Scarry's most famous series of books was about Busytown and revolved around anthropomorphic animals .  While his books are largely populated by common animal species ,  he proved to be quite adept at giving human characteristics to a seemingly endless number of creatures ,  machines ,  and creations .  Many of his later illustrations feature characters in traditional Swiss clothing and show architecturally correct drawings of half-timber houses . The fabric of Scarry's world was woven with a strong sense of community and cooperation .  His characters work together ,  be it building a house or constructing a highway .   And he endowed his characters with an honest humanity that underscores his tales .  Scarry knew children needed to know that they did not have to be perfect all the time . Scarry was a disciplined worker .  In the 1980s and 1990s ,  many of Scarry's Best Ever books were produced as animated videos and aired during TLC's now-defunct Ready Set Learn block .  The Busytown books were also adapted into an animated series ,  The Busy World of Richard Scarry ,  which was produced by Canada-based CINAR (now WildBrain) and Paramount Television and aired on the pay-TV channel Showtime from 1993 to 1997 .  It reran in the late 1990s on Nickelodeon and its sister channel Noggin (now Nick Jr . ) .  A further animated series ,  Busytown Mysteries ,  was commissioned by CBC from the Cookie Jar Group (the successor to CINAR) in 2007 ,  and airs on the Kids' CBC morning program block . Busytown was featured at the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh from June 13 to September 8 ,  2002 ,  in an interactive exhibit ,  Richard Scarry's Busytown . From 1976 to around 1978 ,  Playskool planned Richard Scarry's Puzzletown ,  a series of toy sets featuring plastic figures of Scarry characters and vehicles as well as cardboard scenery that the child could set up in a grid of trenches in a plastic base .  On April 30 ,  1994 in Gstaad ,  Scarry died of a heart attack ,  caused by complications from esophageal cancer .  "

1114,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Maurice_Sendak,Maurice_Sendak,Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing," Sendak was born in Brooklyn ,  New York ,  to Polish Jewish immigrant parents named Sadie (née Schindler) and Philip Sendak ,  a dressmaker .  When he was 12 years old ,  he decided to become an illustrator after watching Walt Disney's film Fantasia .  One of his first professional commissions was to create window displays for the toy store FAO Schwarz .  His illustrations were first published in 1947 in a textbook titled Atomics for the Millions by Maxwell Leigh Eidinoff .  He spent much of the 1950s illustrating children's books written by others before beginning to write his own stories . His older brother Jack Sendak also became an author of children's books ,  two of which were illustrated by Maurice in the 1950s . Maurice was the youngest of three siblings .  When he was born ,  his sister Natalie was 9 years old and his brother Jack ,  five .   Sendak gained international acclaim after writing and illustrating Where the Wild Things Are ,  edited by Ursula Nordstrom at Harper & Row .  It features Max ,  a boy who ""rages against his mother for being sent to bed without any supper"" . Sendak later recounted the reaction of a fan : A little boy sent me a charming card with a little drawing on it .  I loved it .  I answer all my children's letters – sometimes very hastily – but this one I lingered over .  I sent him a card and I drew a picture of a Wild Thing on it .  I wrote ,  'Dear Jim :  I loved your card . ' Then I got a letter back from his mother and she said :  'Jim loved your card so much he ate it . ' That to me was one of the highest compliments I've ever received .  He didn't care that it was an original Maurice Sendak drawing or anything .  He saw it ,  he loved it ,  he ate it . Almost 50 years later ,  School Library Journal sponsored a survey of readers which identified Where the Wild Things Are as a top picture book .  The librarian who conducted it observed that there was little doubt what would be voted number one and highlighted its designation by one reader as a watershed ,  ""ushering in the modern age of picture books"" .  Another called it ""perfectly crafted ,  perfectly illustrated  .  .  .  simply the epitome of a picture book"" and noted that Sendak ""rises above the rest in part because he is subversive . ""When Sendak saw a manuscript of Zlateh the Goat and Other Stories ,  the first children's book by Isaac Bashevis Singer ,  on the desk of an editor at Harper & Row ,  he offered to illustrate the book .  It was first published in 1966 and received a Newbery Honor .  Sendak was delighted and enthusiastic about the collaboration .  He once wryly remarked that his parents were ""finally"" impressed by their youngest child when he collaborated with Singer . His book In the Night Kitchen ,  originally issued in 1970 ,  has often been subjected to censorship for its drawings of a young boy prancing naked through the story .  The book has been challenged in several U . S .  states including Illinois ,  New Jersey ,  Minnesota ,  and Texas . His 1981 book Outside Over There is the story of a girl named Ida and her sibling jealousy and responsibility .  Her father is away ,  so Ida is left to watch her baby sister ,  much to her dismay .  Her sister is kidnapped by goblins and Ida must go off on a magical adventure to rescue her .  At first ,  she is not really eager to get her sister and nearly passes her sister right by when she becomes absorbed in the magic of the quest .  In the end ,  she rescues her baby sister ,  destroys the goblins ,  and returns home committed to caring for her sister until her father returns home . Sendak was an early member of the National Board of Advisors of the Children's Television Workshop during the development stages of the Sesame Street television series .  He also adapted his book Bumble Ardy into an animated sequence for the series ,  with Jim Henson as the voice of Bumble Ardy .  He wrote and designed three other animated stories for the series :  Seven Monsters (which never aired) ,  Up & Down ,  and Broom Adventures . Sendak produced an animated television production based on his work titled Really Rosie ,  featuring the voice of Carole King ,  which was broadcast in 1975 and is available on video (usually as part of video compilations of his work) .  An album of the songs was also produced .  He contributed the opening segment to Simple Gifts ,  a Christmas collection of six animated shorts shown on PBS TV in 1977 and later issued on VHS in 1993 .  He adapted his book Where the Wild Things Are for the stage in 1979 .  Additionally ,  he designed sets for many operas and ballets ,  including the award-winning (1983) Pacific Northwest Ballet production of Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker ,  Glyndebourne Festival Opera's productions of Prokofiev's The Love for Three Oranges (1982) ,  Ravel's L'enfant et les sortilèges and L'heure espagnole (1987) and Oliver Knussen's adaptation of Sendak's own Higglety Pigglety Pop! or There Must Be More to Life (1985) ,  Houston Grand Opera's productions of Mozart's The Magic Flute (1981) and Humperdinck's Hansel and Gretel (1997) ,  Los Angeles County Music Center's 1990 production of Mozart's Idomeneo ,  and the New York City Opera's productions of Janáček's The Cunning Little Vixen (1981) ,  and Mozart's The Goose of Cairo (1984) . In 1993 ,  Sendak published a picture book ,  We Are All in the Dumps with Jack and Guy .  Later in the 1990s ,  Sendak approached playwright Tony Kushner to write a new English version of the Czech composer Hans Krása's children's Holocaust opera Brundibár .  Kushner wrote the text for Sendak's illustrated book of the same name ,  published in 2003 .  The book was named one of The New York Times Book Review's 10 Best Illustrated Books of 2003 . In 2003 ,  Chicago Opera Theatre produced Sendak and Kushner's adaptation of Brundibár .  In 2005 ,  Berkeley Repertory Theatre ,  in collaboration with Yale Repertory Theatre and Broadway's New Victory Theater ,  produced a substantially re-worked version of the Sendak-Kushner adaptation . In 2004 ,  Sendak worked with the Shirim Klezmer Orchestra in Boston on their project Pincus and the Pig :  A Klezmer Tale .  This Klezmer version of Sergei Prokofiev's best-known musical story for children Peter and the Wolf featured Maurice Sendak as the narrator .  He also illustrated the cover art . Sendak also created the Canadian-produced children's animated television series Seven Little Monsters .  Sendak died on May 8 ,  2012 ,  at age 83 ,  in Danbury ,  Connecticut ,  at Danbury Hospital ,  from stroke complications ,  a month before his 84th birthday .  In accordance with his wishes ,  his body was cremated and his ashes were scattered at a location that is not confirmed . The New York Times obituary called Sendak ""the most important children's book artist of the 20th century . ""Comedian Stephen Colbert ,  who interviewed Sendak in one of his last public appearances on his TV program The Colbert Report ,  said of the author :  ""We are all honored to have been briefly invited into his world . ""The 2012 season of Pacific Northwest Ballet's The Nutcracker ,  for which Sendak designed the set ,  was dedicated to his memory . On May 12 ,  2012 ,  Nick Jr .  hosted a two-hour Little Bear marathon in his memory .  The writer of the series Else Holmelund Minarik died herself only two months later on July 12 ,  2012 ,  at the age of 91 . His final book ,  Bumble-Ardy ,  was published eight months before his death .  A posthumous picture book ,  titled My Brother's Book ,  was published in February 2013 . The film Her was dedicated in memory of him and Where the Wild Things Are co-star James Gandolfini .  The film was directed by Spike Jonze ,  who also directed the motion picture adaptation of Where the Wild Things Are .  "

1117,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Shel_Silverstein,Shel_Silverstein,Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing," Sheldon Allan Silverstein was born into a Jewish family in Chicago on September 25 ,  1930 .   Silverstein began drawing at age seven by tracing the works of Al Capp . He was first published in the Roosevelt Torch ,  a student newspaper at Roosevelt University ,  where he studied English after leaving the Art Institute .  During his time in the military ,  his cartoons were published in Pacific Stars and Stripes ,  where he had originally been assigned to do layouts and paste-up .  His first book Take Ten ,  a compilation of his military Take Ten cartoon series ,  was published by Pacific Stars and Stripes in 1955 .  He later said his time in college was a waste and would have been better spent traveling around the world meeting people . After returning to Chicago ,  Silverstein began submitting cartoons to magazines while also selling hot dogs at Chicago ballparks .  His cartoons began appearing in Look ,  Sports Illustrated and This Week . Mass-market paperback readers across America were introduced to Silverstein in 1956 when Take Ten was reprinted by Ballantine Books as Grab Your Socks! The edition included a foreword by Bill Mauldin . In 1957 ,  Silverstein became one of the leading cartoonists in Playboy ,  which sent him around the world to create an illustrated travel journal with reports from far-flung locales .  During the 1950s and 1960s ,  he produced 23 installments called ""Shel Silverstein Visits .  .  . "" as a feature for Playboy .  Employing a sketchbook format with typewriter-styled captions ,  he documented his own experiences at such locations as a New Jersey naturist community ,  the Chicago White Sox training camp ,  San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury ,  Fire Island ,  Mexico ,  London ,  Paris ,  Spain and Africa .  In a Swiss village ,  he drew himself complaining ,  ""I'll give them 15 more minutes ,  and if nobody yodels ,  I'm going back to the hotel . "" These illustrated travel essays were collected by the publisher Fireside in Playboy's Silverstein Around the World ,  published in 2007 with a foreword by Hugh Hefner and an introduction by music journalist Mitch Myers . In a similar vein were his illustrations for John Sack's Report from Practically Nowhere (1959) ,  a collection of humorous travel vignettes previously appearing in Playboy and other magazines . A cartoon he made during the 1950s was featured on the cover of his next cartoon collection ,  titled Now Here's My Plan :  A Book of Futilities ,  which was published by Simon & Schuster in 1960 .  Silverstein biographer Lisa Rogak wrote : The cartoon on the cover that provides the book's title would turn out to be one of his most famous and often-cited cartoons .  In the cartoon ,  two prisoners are chained to the wall of a prison cell .  Both their hands and feet are shackled .  One says to the other ,  ""Now here's my plan . "" Silverstein was both fascinated and distressed by the amount of analysis and commentary that almost immediately began to swirl around the cartoon .  ""A lot of people said it was a very pessimistic cartoon ,  which I don't think it is at all , "" he said .  ""There's a lot of hope even in a hopeless situation .  They analyze it and question it .  I did this cartoon because I had an idea about a funny situation about two guys . ""Silverstein's cartoons appeared in issues of Playboy from 1957 through the mid-1970s ,  and one of his Playboy features was expanded into Uncle Shelby's ABZ Book (Simon & Schuster ,  1961) ,  his first book of new ,  original material for adults .  Because it was unclear whether some of the material was intended for adults or children ,  the 1985 reprint had a conspicuous cover label . Silverstein studied briefly at Chicago College of Performing Arts at Roosevelt University .  His musical output included a large catalog of songs ;  a number of them were hits for other artists ,  most notably the rock group Dr .  Hook & The Medicine Show . He wrote the lyrics and music for most of the Dr .  Hook & the Medicine Show songs on their first few albums ,  including ""The Cover of 'Rolling Stone'"" ,  ""Freakin' at the Freakers' Ball , "" ""Sylvia's Mother"" ,  ""The Things I Didn't Say"" and ""Don't Give a Dose to the One You Love Most"" .  The third album by Tompall Glaser contained eight songs by Silverstein and three by Silverstein and others . Silverstein's ""The Ballad of Lucy Jordan"" ,  first recorded by Dr .  Hook in 1975 ,  was re-recorded by Marianne Faithfull (1979) ,  Belinda Carlisle (1996) ,  and Bobby Bare (2005) and later featured in the films Montenegro and Thelma & Louise .  ""Queen of the Silver Dollar"" was first recorded by Dr .  Hook on their 1972 album Sloppy Seconds ,  and later by Doyle Holly (on his 1973 album Doyle Holly) ,  Barbi Benton (on her 1974 album Barbi Doll) ,  Emmylou Harris (on her 1975 album Pieces of the Sky) and Dave & Sugar (on their 1976 album Dave & Sugar) . Silverstein composed original music for several films and displayed a musical versatility in these projects ,  playing guitar ,  piano ,  saxophone and trombone .  He wrote ""In the Hills of Shiloh"" ,  a poignant song about the aftermath of the American Civil War ,  recorded by The New Christy Minstrels ,  Judy Collins ,  Bobby Bare ,  and others .  The soundtrack of the 1970 film Ned Kelly features Silverstein songs performed by Waylon Jennings ,  Kris Kristofferson ,  and others .  He also co-wrote with Waylon the song 'A Long Time Ago' . In addition ,  Silverstein wrote ""Hey Nelly Nelly , "" a 1960s-era folk song recorded by Judy Collins . Silverstein had a popular following on Dr .  Demento's radio show .  Among his better-known comedy songs were ""Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout (Would Not Take the Garbage Out)"" ,  ""The Smoke-Off"" (a tale of a contest to determine who could roll—or smoke—marijuana joints faster) ,  ""I Got Stoned and I Missed It"" and ""Stacy Brown Got Two . "" He wrote ""The Father of a Boy Named Sue"" ,  in which he tells the story from the original song from the father's point of view ,  and the 1962 song ""Boa Constrictor"" ,  sung by a person who is being swallowed by a snake (recorded by the folk group Peter ,  Paul ,  and Mary) as well as recorded by Johnny Cash for his 1966 album Everybody Loves a Nut . One of the latter musical projects Silverstein completed in his lifetime was Old Dogs ,  a 1998 album with songs about getting old ,  all of which Silverstein wrote or co-wrote . A longtime friend of singer-songwriter Pat Dailey ,  Silverstein collaborated with him on the posthumously released Underwater Land album (2002) .  It contains 17 children's songs written and produced by Silverstein and sung by Dailey (with Silverstein joining him on a few tracks) .  The album features art by Silverstein . He was a friend of Chicago songwriter Steve Goodman ,  for whom he wrote the final verse of ""What Have You Done For Me Lately?"" (refusing a songwriting credit for his contribution) .  Goodman also recorded Silverstein's ""Three-Legged Man"" ,  as did Ray Stevens . In 2010 ,  Bobby Bare and his son Bobby Bare Jr produced a CD called Twistable ,  Turnable Man :  A Musical Tribute to the Songs of Shel Silverstein which was released on Sugar Hill Records .  Other artists recording Silverstein songs include the Brothers Four ,  Andrew Bird ,  My Morning Jacket and Bobby Bare ,  Jr . In January 1959 ,  Look ,  Charlie :  A Short History of the Pratfall was a chaotic off-Broadway comedy staged by Silverstein ,  Jean Shepherd and Herb Gardner at New York's Orpheum Theatre on Second Avenue in the Lower East Side . A production of An Adult Evening of Shel Silverstein was produced by a Hofstra University theater group named The Spectrum Players ,  founded by Francis Ford Coppola in 1959 .  The production used a ""victorian sailors on shore leave watching a play"" aesthetic and used live rag-time and a character of an emcee not in the script to transition between pieces .  The production was directed by Richard Traub of Chicago and starred several of Hofstra's most promising young actors :  Nick Pacifico ,  Amanda Mac ,  Mike Quattrone ,  Ross Greenberg ,  Chelsea Lando ,  Allie Rightmeyer ,  and Paolo Perez as the MC . In December 2001 ,  Shel's Shorts was produced in repertory as two separate evenings under the titles Signs of Trouble and Shel Shocked by the Market Theater in Cambridge ,  Massachusetts .

1121,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/James_Thurber,James_Thurber,Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing,"   Uniquely among major American literary figures ,  he became equally well known for his simple ,  surrealistic drawings and cartoons .  Both his skills were helped along by the support of ,  and collaboration with ,  fellow New Yorker staff member E .  B .  White ,  who insisted that Thurber's sketches could stand on their own as artistic expressions .  Thurber drew six covers and numerous classic illustrations for The New Yorker . The last twenty years of Thurber's life were filled with material and professional success in spite of his blindness .  He published at least fourteen more books ,  including The Thurber Carnival (1945) ,  Thurber Country (1953) ,  and the extremely popular account of the life of New Yorker editor Harold Ross ,  The Years with Ross (1959) .  A number of his short stories were made into movies ,  including The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (1947) .  Many of his short stories are humorous fictional memoirs from his life ,  but he also wrote darker material ,  such as ""The Whip-Poor-Will"" ,  a story of madness and murder .  His best-known short stories are ""The Dog That Bit People"" and ""The Night the Bed Fell"" ;  they can be found in My Life and Hard Times ,  which was his ""break-out"" book .  Among his other classics are The Secret Life of Walter Mitty ,  The Catbird Seat ,  The Night the Ghost Got In ,  A Couple of Hamburgers ,  The Greatest Man in the World ,  If Grant Had Been Drinking at Appomattox .  The Middle-Aged Man on the Flying Trapeze has several short stories with a tense undercurrent of marital discord .  The book was published the year of his divorce and remarriage . His 1941 story ""You Could Look It Up"" , In addition to his other fiction ,  Thurber wrote over seventy-five fables ,  some of which were first published in ""The New Yorker"" (1939) ,  then collected in Fables for Our Time & Famous Poems Illustrated (1940) and Further Fables for Our Time (1956) .  These were short stories that featured anthropomorphic animals (e . g .  The Little Girl and the Wolf ,  his version of Little Red Riding Hood) as main characters ,  and ended with a moral as a tagline .  An exception to this format was his most famous fable ,  The Unicorn in the Garden ,  which featured an all-human cast except for the unicorn ,  which doesn't speak .  Thurber's fables were satirical ,  and the morals served as punchlines as well as advice to the reader ,  demonstrating ""the complexity of life by depicting the world as an uncertain ,  precarious place ,  where few reliable guidelines exist . ""His stories also included several book-length fairy tales ,  such as The White Deer (1945) ,  The 13 Clocks (1950) and The Wonderful O (1957) .  The latter was one of several of Thurber's works illustrated by Marc Simont .  Thurber's prose for The New Yorker and other venues included numerous humorous essays .  A favorite subject ,  especially toward the end of his life ,  was the English language .  Pieces on this subject included ""The Spreading 'You Know' , "" which decried the overuse of that pair of words in conversation ,  ""The New Vocabularianism"" ,  ""What Do You Mean It Was Brillig?"" ,  and many others .  His short pieces – whether stories ,  essays or something in between – were referred to as ""casuals"" by Thurber and the staff of The New Yorker . Thurber wrote a biographical memoir about the founder/publisher of The New Yorker ,  Harold Ross ,  entitled The Years with Ross (1958) .  He wrote a five-part New Yorker series ,  between 1947 and 1948 ,  examining in depth the radio soap opera phenomenon ,  based on near-constant listening and researching over the same period .  Leaving nearly no element of these programs unexamined ,  including their writers ,  producers ,  sponsors ,  performers ,  and listeners alike ,  Thurber republished the series in his anthology ,  The Beast in Me and Other Animals (1948) ,  under the section title ""Soapland . "" The series was one of the first to examine such a pop-culture phenomenon in depth . While Thurber drew his cartoons in the usual fashion in the 1920s and 1930s ,  his failing eyesight later required changes .  He drew them on very large sheets of paper using a thick black crayon (or on black paper using white chalk ,  from which they were photographed and the colors reversed for publication) .  Regardless of method ,  his cartoons became as noted as his writings ;  they possessed an eerie ,  wobbly feel that seems to mirror his idiosyncratic view on life .  He once wrote that people said it looked like he drew them under water .  Dorothy Parker ,  a contemporary and friend of Thurber ,  referred to his cartoons as having the ""semblance of unbaked cookies"" .  The last drawing Thurber completed was a self-portrait in yellow crayon on black paper ,  which was featured as the cover of Time magazine on July 9 ,  1951 .  The same drawing was used for the dust jacket of The Thurber Album (1952) .  Thurber's behavior became erratic and unpredictable in his last year .  At a party hosted by Noël Coward ,  Thurber was taken back to the Algonquin Hotel at six in the morning .  Thurber was stricken with a blood clot on the brain on October 4 ,  1961 ,  and underwent emergency surgery ,  drifting in and out of consciousness .  Although the operation was initially successful ,  Thurber died a few weeks later ,  on November 2 ,  aged 66 ,  due to complications from pneumonia .  The doctors said his brain was senescent from several small strokes and hardening of the arteries .  His last words ,  aside from the repeated word ""God"" ,  were ""God bless .  .  .  God damn"" ,  according to his wife ,  Helen .  "

1126,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Albert_Uderzo,Albert_Uderzo,Writers_who_illustrated_their_own_writing," Uderzo was born in Fismes in the Marne department of France on 25 April 1927 as the fourth child of Italian immigrants Silvio Uderzo (1888–1985)I once asked  :  ""Why did you give me an Italian first name ,  considering we live in France?"" His reply was typical for him :  ""I didn't try to register you as Alberto ,  but instead as Alberto . "" It was hopeless .  Without noticing it ,  my father pronounced 'Albert' the Italian way . Uderzo was born on the morning of 25 April 1927 around 07 : 00 .  At this point ,  he was an Italian citizen rather than a French one .  Uderzo was born with six fingers on each hand .  The additional fingers were surgically removed early in childhood as a precaution ,  as the infant Uderzo would sometimes violently pull on them when enraged or annoyed . In 1929 ,  the Uderzos moved to Clichy-sous-Bois in the eastern suburbs of Paris ,  the capital city of France .  Here ,  Uderzo experienced elements of racism against Italian immigrants during his childhood ,  even though he gained French citizenship in the year 1934 .  Clichy-sous-Bois ,  at the time a very politically left-leaning political district ,  held deep popular sentiments against Mussolini's dictatorship and its involvement in the Spanish Civil War .  Uderzo at one particular point became the target of the anger of a victim of Italian-German bombardment in the Spanish Civil War ,  and said a man spat in his face .  However ,  apart from the occasional ethnic resentment against Italians ,  Uderzo views his childhood and education in Clichy-sous-Bois fondly in retrospect .  His mother gave birth to two more children :  Jeanne was born in 1932 and Marcel in 1933 . Uderzo came in touch with the arts for the first time during kindergarten ,  where he was noted as talented for his age .  Most of his siblings also shared certain artistic talents ,  and their mother used sheets of paper and pencils to give the children ,  especially her oldest son Bruno ,  something to do .  Bruno became an inspiration for Albert and in turn ,  soon noted the younger brother's talent .  At this point ,  Albert did not yet aim to become a professional artist later in life and instead dreamt about a career as a clown and ,  after dropping that aspiration ,  aimed to follow Bruno into the craft of aircraft engineering .  At the same time ,  he came in contact with the American comic and animated cartoon cultures ,  particularly with the early works of Walt Disney like Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck .  The family moved to the Rue de Montreuil in the 11th arrondissement of Paris in October 1938 ,  changing both schools and the social vicinity .  Although Albert ,  blond and now with a Parisian accent ,  was no longer easily recognized as of Italian heritage ,  he nonetheless had problems in school .  His only successful area in his educational pursuits was sketching and the arts .  It would take him until around the age of 11 or 12 to go from sketching to painting in colors ,  however ,  which was when his parents discovered that Uderzo was color blind .  From then on ,  Uderzo would use labels on his colors ,  but as he mostly stuck with black-and-white sketching ,  it would not make a huge impact on his artistic career either way . In September 1939 ,  Germany invaded Poland and France declared war on Germany in response .  Albert's father Silvio ,  by then 51 ,  was too old to be conscripted into the French army ,  whereas Albert himself was too young at 12 .  Bruno ,  however ,  was of military age and was called to action .  He survived his military service without injury ,  and the Battle of France lasted between 10 May and 25 June 1940 ,  ending in a decisive German victory and resulting in a German occupation of France .  Albert soon finished his basic education at the age of 13 and decided to follow Bruno into aircraft engineering .    On 24 March 2020 ,  Uderzo died in his sleep at his house in Neuilly-sur-Seine ,  after suffering a heart attack .  His son-in-law Bernard de Choisy said the heart attack was not linked to COVID-19 ,  and that Uderzo had felt very tired for several weeks prior to his death .  "

1134,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Banksy,Banksy,Political_artists,"   Banksy started as a freehand graffiti artist in 1990–1994Banksy's stencils feature striking and humorous images occasionally combined with slogans .  The message is usually anti-war ,  anti-capitalist ,  or anti-establishment .  Subjects often include rats ,  apes ,  policemen ,  soldiers ,  children ,  and the elderly . In July 2011 one of Banksy's early works ,  Gorilla in a Pink Mask ,  which had been a prominent landmark on the exterior wall of a former social club in Eastville for over ten years ,  was unwittingly painted over after the premises became a Muslim cultural centre . On 19 July 2002 ,  Banksy's first Los Angeles exhibition debuted at 33 . mw-parser-output  . frac{white-space : nowrap} . mw-parser-output  . frac  . num ,  . mw-parser-output  . frac  . den{font-size : 80% ; line-height : 0 ; vertical-align : super} . mw-parser-output  . frac  . den{vertical-align : sub} . mw-parser-output  . sr-only{border : 0 ; clip : rect(0 , 0 , 0 , 0) ; height : 1px ; margin : -1px ; overflow : hidden ; padding : 0 ; position : absolute ; width : 1px}1⁄3 Gallery ,  a tiny Silver Lake venue owned by Frank Sosa and was on view until 18 August . In 2003 ,  at an exhibition called Turf War ,  held in a London warehouse ,  Banksy painted on animals .  At the time he gave one of his very few interviews ,  to the BBC's Nigel Wrench . Banksy ,  along with Shepard Fairey ,  Dmote ,  and others ,  created work at a warehouse exhibition in Alexandria ,  Sydney ,  for Semi-Permanent in 2003 .  Approximately 1 , 500 people attended . In August 2004 ,  Banksy produced a quantity of spoof British £10 notesThe reproduction of images of the banknotes classifies as a criminal offence (s . 18 Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981) .  In 2016 ,  the American Numismatic Society received an email from a Reproductions Officer at the Bank of England ,  which brought attention to the illegality of publishing photos of the banknotes on their website without prior permission . Also in 2004 ,  Banksy created a limited edition screenprint titled Napalm (Can't Beat That Feeling) .  In the print ,  Banksy appropriated the image of Phan Thi Kim Phuc ,  a Vietnamese girl who appeared in the iconic 1972 photograph The Terror of War by Nick Ut .  Napalm shows the image of Kim Phuc as seen in the original photo ,  but no longer within the tragic war setting .  Instead ,  he situates the young girl against an empty background ,  still screaming ,  but now accompanied by Ronald McDonald and Mickey Mouse .  The two characters hold her hands as they cheerfully gesture to an invisible audience ,  seemingly oblivious to the terrified girl .  The image of Kim Phuc is flat ,  grainy and monochromatic ;  in most of the prints ,  Ronald McDonald and Mickey Mouse are yellow .  In a few limited prints ,  the corporate characters wear pink or orange .  Banksy produced 150 signed and 500 unsigned copies of Napalm . In August 2005 ,  Banksy ,  on a trip to the Palestinian territories ,  created nine images on the Israeli West Bank wall . There are crimes that become innocent and even glorious through their splendour ,  number and excess . BanksyBanksy held an exhibition called Barely Legal ,  billed as a ""three-day vandalised warehouse extravaganza"" in Los Angeles ,  on the weekend of 16 September 2006 .  The exhibition featured a live ""elephant in a room"" ,  painted in a pink and gold floral wallpaper pattern ,  which ,  according to leaflets handed out at the exhibition ,  was intended to draw attention to the issue of world poverty .  Although the Animal Services Department had issued a permit for the elephant ,  after complaints from animal rights activists ,  the elephant appeared unpainted on the final day .  Its owners rejected claims of mistreatment and said that the elephant had done ""many ,  many movies .  She's used to makeup . ""After Christina Aguilera bought an original of Queen Victoria as a lesbian and two prints for £25 , 000 , On 21 February 2007 ,  Sotheby's auction house in London auctioned three works ,  reaching the highest ever price for a Banksy work at auction :  over £102 , 000 for Bombing Middle England .  Two of his other graffiti works ,  Girl with Balloon and Bomb Hugger ,  sold for £37 , 200 and £31 , 200 respectively ,  which were well above their estimated prices . In February 2007 ,  the owners of a house with a Banksy mural on the side in Bristol decided to sell the house through Red Propeller art gallery after offers fell through because the prospective buyers wanted to remove the mural .  It is listed as a mural that comes with a house attached . In April 2007 ,  Transport for London painted over Banksy's image of a scene from Quentin Tarantino's film Pulp Fiction (1994) ,  featuring Samuel L .  Jackson and John Travolta clutching bananas instead of guns .  Although the image was very popular ,  Transport for London claimed that the graffiti created ""a general atmosphere of neglect and social decay which in turn encourages crime"" and their staff are ""professional cleaners not professional art critics"" .  Banksy depicted an angel wearing a bullet-proof vest holding a skull .  He also wrote a note on his website saying : The last time I hit this spot I painted a crap picture of two men in banana costumes waving handguns .  A few weeks later a writer called Ozone completely dogged it and then wrote ""If it's better next time I'll leave it"" in the bottom corner .  When we lost Ozone we lost a fearless graffiti writer and as it turns out a pretty perceptive art critic .  Ozone—rest in peace . On 27 April 2007 ,  a new record high for the sale of Banksy's work was set with the auction of the work Space Girl and Bird fetching £288 , 000 (US$576 , 000) around 20 times the estimate at Bonhams of London . Banksy has published a ""manifesto"" on his website . Banksy ,  who ""is not represented by any of the commercial galleries that sell his work second hand (including Lazarides Ltd ,  Andipa Gallery ,  Bank Robber ,  Dreweatts etc . )"" , In March ,  Nathan Wellard and Maev Neal ,  a couple from Norfolk ,  UK ,  made headlines in Britain when they decided to sell their mobile home that contains a 30-foot mural ,  entitled Fragile Silence ,  done by Banksy a decade prior to his rise to fame . Also in March 2008 ,  a stencilled graffiti work appeared on Thames Water tower in the middle of the Holland Park roundabout ,  and it was widely attributed to Banksy .  It was of a child painting the tag ""Take this—Society!"" in bright orange .  London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham spokesman ,  Councillor Greg Smith branded the art as vandalism ,  and ordered its immediate removal ,  which was carried out by H&F council workmen within three days . In late August 2008 ,  marking the third anniversary of Hurricane Katrina and the associated levee failure disaster ,  Banksy produced a series of works in New Orleans ,  Louisiana ,  mostly on buildings derelict since the disaster . A stencil painting attributed to Banksy appeared at a vacant petrol station in the Ensley neighbourhood of Birmingham ,  Alabama on 29 August as Hurricane Gustav approached the New Orleans area .  The painting ,  depicting a hooded member of the Ku Klux Klan hanging from a noose ,  was quickly covered with black spray paint and later removed altogether . The Westminster City Council stated in October 2008 that the work One Nation Under CCTV ,  painted in April 2008 would be painted over as it was graffiti .  The council said it would remove any graffiti ,  regardless of the reputation of its creator ,  and specifically stated that Banksy ""has no more right to paint graffiti than a child"" .  Robert Davis ,  the chairman of the council planning committee told The Times newspaper :  ""If we condone this then we might as well say that any kid with a spray can is producing art . ""In London ,  over the weekend 3–5 May 2008 ,  Banksy hosted an exhibition called The Cans Festival .  It was situated on Leake Street ,  a road tunnel formerly used by Eurostar underneath London Waterloo station .  Graffiti artists with stencils were invited to join in and paint their own artwork ,  as long as it did not cover anyone else's . In May 2009 ,  Banksy parted company with agent Steve Lazarides and announced that Pest Control , In December 2009 ,  Banksy marked the end of the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference by painting four murals on global warming .  One included the phrase ,  ""I don't believe in global warming ; "" the words were submerged in water . The world premiere of the film Exit Through the Gift Shop occurred at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City ,  Utah ,  on 24 January .  He created 10 street artworks around Park City and Salt Lake City to tie in with the screening . In March 2010 ,  a modified version of the work Forgive Us Our Trespassing–a kneeling boy with a spray-painted halo–was displayed at London Bridge Station on a poster .  This version of the work did not possess the halo due to its stylistic nature and the prevalence of graffiti in the underground . Banksy paints over the line between aesthetics and language ,  then stealthily repaints it in the unlikeliest of places .  His works ,  whether he stencils them on the streets ,  sells them in exhibitions or hangs them in museums on the sly ,  are filled with wit and metaphors that transcend language barriers . Shepard Fairey in Time magazine on Banksy's entry in the Time 100 list ,  April 2010In April ,  to coincide with the premiere of Exit Through the Gift Shop in San Francisco ,  five of his works appeared in various parts of the city .  though most have been subsequently painted over or removed . In May ,  to coincide with the premiere of Exit Through the Gift Shop in Royal Oak ,  Banksy visited the Detroit area and left his mark in several places in Detroit and Warren . In late January 2011 ,  Exit Through the Gift Shop was nominated for a 2010 Oscar for Best Documentary Feature .  Exit Through the Gift Shop was broadcast on British public television station Channel 4 on 13 August 2011 . Banksy was credited with the opening couch gag for the 2010 The Simpsons episode ""MoneyBart"" ,  depicting people working in deplorable conditions and using endangered or mythical animals to make both the episodes cel-by-cel and the merchandise connected with the program . In May 2011 Banksy released a lithographic print which showed a smoking petrol bomb contained in a 'Tesco Value' bottle .  This followed a long-running campaign by locals against the opening of a Tesco Express supermarket in Banksy's home city of Bristol .  Violent clashes had taken place between police and demonstrators in the Stokes Croft area .  Banksy produced the poster ostensibly to raise money for local groups in the Stokes Croft area and to raise money for the legal defence of those arrested during the riots .  The posters were sold exclusively at the Bristol Anarchists Bookfair in Stokes Croft for £5 each . In December ,  he unveiled Cardinal Sin at the Walker Art Gallery ,  Liverpool .  The bust ,  which replaces a priest's face with a ""pixelated"" effect ,  was a statement on the child abuse scandal in the Catholic Church . In May his Parachuting Rat ,  painted in Melbourne in the late 1990s ,  was accidentally destroyed by plumbers installing new pipes . In July ,  prior to the 2012 Olympic Games Banksy posted photographs of paintings with an Olympic theme on his website but did not disclose their location . On 18 February ,  BBC News reported that a recent Banksy mural ,  known as the Slave Labour mural portraying a young child sewing Union Flag bunting (created around the time of the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II) had been removed from the side of a Poundland store in Wood Green ,  north London ,  and soon appeared for sale in Fine Art Auctions Miami's catalogue (a US auction site based in Florida) .  News of this had reportedly caused ""lots of anger"" in the local community and is considered by some to be a theft .  Fine Art Auctions Miami had rejected claims of theft ,  saying it had signed a contract with a ""well-known collector"" and that ""everything was above board"" ;  despite this ,  the local Councillor for Wood Green campaigned for the work's return . On the scheduled day of the auction ,  Fine Art Auctions Miami announced that it had withdrawn the work of art from the sale . On 11 May ,  BBC News reported that the same Banksy mural was up for auction again in Covent Garden by the Sincura Group .  The auction was scheduled to take place in June ,  and was expected to fetch up to £450 , 000 .  On 24 September ,  after over a year since his previous piece ,  a new mural went up on his website along with the subtitle Better Out Than In . On 1 October 2013 ,  Banksy began a one-month ""show on the streets of New York A pop-up boutique of about 25 spray-art canvases appeared on Fifth Avenue near Central Park on 12 October .  Tourists were able to buy Banksy art for just $60 each .  In a note posted to his website ,  the artist wrote :  ""Please note this was a one-off .  The stall will not be there again . "" The BBC estimated that the street-stall art pieces could be worth as much as $31 , 000 .  The booth was manned by an unknown elderly man who went about four hours before making a sale ,  yawning and eating lunch as people strolled by without a second glance at the work .  Banksy chronicled the surprise sale in a video posted to his website noting ,  ""Yesterday I set up a stall in the park selling 100% authentic original signed Banksy canvases .  For $60 each . ""Asked about the artist's presence in New York ,  then-New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg ,  who had led a citywide graffiti cleanup operation in 2002 ,  said he didn't consider graffiti a form of art . In February 2015 Banksy published a 2-minute video titled Make this the year YOU discover a new destination about his trip to Gaza Strip .  During the visit he painted a few artworks including a kitten on the remains of a house destroyed by an Israeli air strike (""I wanted to highlight the destruction in Gaza by posting photos on my website—but on the internet people only look at pictures of kittens"") and a swing hanging off a watchtower .  In a statement to The New York Times his publicist said , I don't want to take sides .  But when you see entire suburban neighbourhoods reduced to rubble with no hope of a future—what you're really looking at is a vast outdoor recruitment centre for terrorists .  And we should probably address this for all our sakes . Banksy opened Dismaland ,  a large scale group show modelled on Disneyland on 21 August 2015 .   It lampooned the many disappointing temporary themed attractions in the UK at the time .   Dismaland permanently closed on 27 September 2015 .  The ""theme park"" was located in Weston-super-Mare ,  United Kingdom . In December 2015 ,  Banksy created several murals in the vicinity of Calais ,  France ,  including the so-called ""Jungle"" where migrants then lived as they attempted to enter the United Kingdom .   One of the pieces ,  The Son of a Migrant from Syria ,  depicts Steve Jobs as a migrant . In 2017 ,  marking the 100th anniversary of the British control of Palestine ,  Banksy financed the creation of the Walled Off Hotel in Bethlehem .  This hotel is open to the public and contains rooms designed by Banksy ,  Sami Musa ,  and Dominique Petrin ,  and each of the bedrooms face the wall .  It also houses a contemporary art gallery . 2018 saw Banksy return to New York five years after his Better Out Than In residency .  A trademark rat running around the circumference of a clock-face ,  dubbed Rat race ,  was torn down by developers within a week of it appearing on a former bank building at 101 West 14th Street , In October 2018 ,  one of Banksy's works ,  Balloon Girl ,  was sold in an auction at Sotheby's in London for £1 . 04m .  However ,  shortly after the gavel dropped and it was sold ,  an alarm sounded inside of the picture frame and the canvas passed through a shredder hidden within the frame ,  partially shredding the picture . The woman who won the bidding at the auction decided to go through with the purchase .   The partially shredded work has been given a new title ,  Love is in the Bin ,  and it was authenticated by Banksy's authentication body Pest Control .  Sotheby released a statement that said ""Banksy didn't destroy an artwork in the auction ,  he created one , "" and called it ""the first artwork in history to have been created live during an auction . ""A two-sided graffiti piece ,  one side depicting a child tasting the falling snow ,  the other revealing that the snow is in fact smoke and embers from a dumpster fire ,  appeared on two walls of a steelworker's garage in Port Talbot in December . In early October 2019 ,  Banksy opened a ""pop-up shop"" named Gross Domestic Product in Croydon ,  South London to strengthen his position in a trademark dispute with a greetings cards company who had challenged his trademark on the grounds that he was not using it .  In a statement ,  Banksy said ""A greetings cards company is contesting the trademark I hold to my art ,  and attempting to take custody of my name so they can sell their fake Banksy merchandise legally . ""On 4 October 2019 ,  greetings cards distributor Full Colour Black publicly revealed itself as the company involved in the trademark dispute whilst rejecting Banksy's claims as ""entirely untrue"" .  The company claimed it had contacted Banksy's lawyers several times to offer to pay royalties . On 14 September 2020 ,  the European Union Intellectual Property Office ruled in favour of Full Colour Black in the trademark dispute over Banksy's infamous ""Flower Thrower"" . In October 2019 ,  Devolved Parliament ,  a 2009 painting by Banksy showing Members of Parliament depicted as chimpanzees in the House of Commons ,  sold at Sotheby's in London for just under £9 . 9million .  On Instagram ,  the artist said it was a ""record price for a Banksy painting"" and ""shame I didn't still own it"" . On 13 February 2020 ,  the Valentine's Banksy mural appeared on the side of a building in Bristol's Barton Hill neighbourhood ,  depicting a young girl firing a slingshot of real red flowers and leaves . Banksy dedicated a painting titled Painting for Saints or Game Changer to NHS staff ,  and donated it to the University Hospital of Southampton during the global coronavirus pandemic in May 2020 . In March 2021 ,  the image of an escaping prisoner appeared overnight on the side of Reading Prison . Two days later Banksy claimed the artwork .  The former jail's next use had been disputed locally ,  some wanting it to be used as an arts hub ,  while developers proposed it could be sold to a housing developer . The escaping prisoner was said to resemble Oscar Wilde ,  who had been imprisoned in Reading Prison ,  with the ""rope"" as tied together bedsheets with a typewriter attached to the end . In August 2021 ,  several Banksy artworks ,  collectively titled A Great British Spraycation ,  appeared in several East Anglian towns . Banksy created an original artwork for the 2021 BBC One/Amazon Prime Video comedy The Outlaws .  The image of a stencilled rat sitting on two spray cans signed by Banksy featured in the sixth episode of the first series ,  and was painted over by the character Frank ,  played by Christopher Walken ,  while he was cleaning a graffiti-covered wall as part of his Community Payback sentence .

Mary Brennan ,  reviewing the National Review of Live Art in 2001 ,  described the effect on Chakravarthi of his move to the UK as follows :  entered into a kind of mirror-maze ,  where he found himself searching for a sense of who he was .

1160,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Mark_Farid,Mark_Farid,Political_artists,"   Farid’s 2015 project Data Shadow was covered by several news publications . In conjunction with the exhibition Farid gave a talk at the festival titled ""Anonymity is our only right ,  and that is why it must be destroyed , "" where he declared an intention to live without a digital footprint for six months ,  and gave away all his login details to the audience .  This included all personal and professional email addresses ,  social media profiles ,  Apple ID ,  and (closed) online banking details .  Reflecting on the experience in an article written a year later for The Telegraph ,  Farid explained the other measures he took and the effects they had on him : ""What proved very apparent very quickly is that as a 23/24 year old living in London ,  there is no real choice over the usage of many digital and online platforms ,  let alone the choice of using a computer or mobile phone .  Without them ,  my social ,  cultural ,  and financial life – and I’d go so far as to say my mental stability – were all affected in negative ways . ""Poisonous Antidote ran online and at Gazelli Art House in London throughout September 2016 .  This project saw Farid broadcasting every facet of his online presence :  all personal and professional emails ,  text messages ,  Skype and Facebook chats ,  web browsing ,  phone calls ,  and Twitter and Instagram feeds made up the content of the show .  All of his pictures and videos appeared in real time ,  and his phones’ locations were updated every twenty minutes .  The exhibition was a collaboration with the designer Vicente Gasco ,  who wrote an algorithm to 3D print each day’s data in the gallery .  Over the course of the display a physical digital landscape grew beside the projected live newsfeeds and audio . “Unlike Data Shadow , ” wrote Farid ,  “where I gave up online privacy to gain personal privacy ,  only to realise social media is indispensable to contemporary life ,  Poisonous Antidote embraces the publicity of social media .  Subsequently ,  I have found that I’m consciously and subconsciously changing my actions and behaviour to ensure I conform to society’s ideologies – that I am doing what I’m ""meant"" to be and feeling validated by the knowledge people can see this . ” In 2017 Farid was invited to give a TEDx talk on the Data Shadow and Poisonous Antidote projects ,  which took place in Warwick under the title “Data Privacy :  Good or Bad?”Seeing I was originally put on Kickstarter in November 2014 .  Within two days the project went viral and received worldwide media attention ,  with coverage in Sky News ,  Fox News ,  BBC ,  The Guardian ,  The Times of India ,  The Independent ,  Vice ,  and other stations and publications . Farid’s original proposal for Seeing I was to spend a month living in virtual reality ,  on display in an art gallery while wearing a VR headset and noise-cancelling headphones .  The feed would be provided by “the other , ” a volunteer wearing a pair of spectacles transmitting a first-person perspective to Farid’s headset .  Human contact would be limited to an hour’s daily psychiatric observation .  The project aimed to discover the effects of total immersion in another person’s visual sense-world . Every moment of Farid’s sleep pattern ,  diet ,  and sanitary schedule would be dictated by his counterpart ,  inverting the interactivity of VR games .  Keith Stuart ,  writing in The Guardian ,  noted this difference and saw the project as addressing perennial philosophical questions :  “Is the body a mere sensory vessel for the brain ,  or is identity inextricably linked to its physical manifestation?”Professor Simon Baron-Cohen ,  of the University of Cambridge ,  has commented that ""One might imagine various outcomes of this experiment :  that he might become more empathic ,  being Other- rather than self-focused ;  that he might experience distorted perceptions and even delusions ,  given that his own brain is not receiving its normal input but instead is experiencing a kind of sensory deprivation ;  or that he might establish that the brain can in fact adapt relatively quickly (hours or days?) to a new reality ,  and then adapt back again at the end of the experiment ,  with no serious side-effects .  Whatever the result ,  Other medical professionals have expressed concern for Farid’s mental health .  Professor Barbara Sahakian ,  of the University of Cambridge and the Medical Research Council ,  said :  “I am concerned about how such a long project which involves voyeurism on the part of Mark and also on the part of the public in regard to Mark will affect his mental health and wellbeing .  It could be extremely disturbing and it is unclear whether any potential damage to Mark's mental health could be repaired . ”  Since its inception the timeframe of Farid’s immersion has been scaled down from twenty-eight days to seven . A pilot of Seeing I took place at the 2019 Ars Electronica Digital Arts Festival .  Over a week Farid spent nine continuous hours each day in VR ,  experiencing the life of a different person .  Visitors to the exhibition were able to share what Farid was seeing using headsets in the gallery ,  whilst Farid was on constant display to the public . Since 2019 it has been exhibited in several forms and venues and is currently scheduled for 2022 ,  with the final date to be confirmed .   "

They sought to organize the pictorial surface without using traditional devices . Although their methods differed greatly ,  most of the work was monochromatic ,  geometric ,  kinetic ,  and gestural . These early installations focused on systems and processes .

1176,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/William_Hogarth,William_Hogarth,Political_artists," William Hogarth was born at Bartholomew Close in London to Richard Hogarth ,  a poor Latin school teacher and textbook writer ,  and Anne Gibbons .  In his youth he was apprenticed to the engraver Ellis Gamble in Leicester Fields ,  where he learned to engrave trade cards and similar products . Young Hogarth also took a lively interest in the street life of the metropolis and the London fairs ,  and amused himself by sketching the characters he saw .   Around the same time ,  his father ,  who had opened an unsuccessful Latin-speaking coffee house at St John's Gate ,  was imprisoned for debt in the Fleet Prison for five years .  Hogarth never spoke of his father's imprisonment . In 1720 ,  Hogarth enrolled at the original St Martin's Lane Academy in Peter Court ,  London ,  which was run by Louis Chéron and John Vanderbank .  He attended alongside other future leading figures in art and design ,  such as Joseph Highmore ,  William Kent ,  and Arthur Pond . Hogarth became a member of the Rose and Crown Club ,  with Peter Tillemans ,  George Vertue ,  Michael Dahl ,  and other artists and connoisseurs .   By April 1720 ,  Hogarth was an engraver in his own right ;  at first engraving coats of arms ,  shop bills ,  and designing plates for booksellers . In 1727 ,  he was hired by Joshua Morris ,  a tapestry worker ,  to prepare a design for the Element of Earth .  Morris heard that he was ""an engraver ,  and no painter"" ,  and consequently declined the work when completed .  Hogarth accordingly sued him for the money in the Westminster Court ,  where the case was decided in his favour on 28 May 1728 . Early satirical works included an Emblematical Print on the South Sea Scheme (c . 1721 ,  published 1724) ,  about the disastrous stock market crash of 1720 ,  known as the South Sea Bubble ,  in which many English people lost a great deal of money .  In the bottom left corner ,  he shows Protestant ,  Roman Catholic ,  and Jewish figures gambling ,  while in the middle there is a huge machine ,  like a merry-go-round ,  which people are boarding .  At the top is a goat ,  written below which is ""Who'l Ride"" .  The people are scattered around the picture with a sense of disorder ,  while the progress of the well dressed people towards the ride in the middle shows the foolishness of the crowd in buying stock in the South Sea Company ,  which spent more time issuing stock than anything else . Other early works include The Lottery (1724) ;  The Mystery of Masonry brought to Light by the Gormagons (1724) ;   A Just View of the British Stage (1724) ;  some book illustrations ;  and the small print Masquerades and Operas (1724) .  The latter is a satire on contemporary follies ,  such as the masquerades of the Swiss impresario John James Heidegger ,  the popular Italian opera singers ,  John Rich's pantomimes at Lincoln's Inn Fields ,  and the exaggerated popularity of Lord Burlington's protégé ,  the architect and painter William Kent .  He continued that theme in 1727 ,  with the Large Masquerade Ticket .  In 1726 ,  Hogarth prepared twelve large engravings illustrating Samuel Butler's Hudibras .  These he himself valued highly ,  and they are among his best book illustrations . In the following years ,  he turned his attention to the production of small ""conversation pieces"" (i . e .  ,  groups in oil of full-length portraits from 12 to 15 inches (300 to 380mm) high .  Among his efforts in oil between 1728 and 1732 were The Fountaine Family (c . 1730) ,  The Assembly at Wanstead House ,  The House of Commons examining Bambridge ,  and several pictures of the chief actors in John Gay's popular The Beggar's Opera . One of Hogarth's masterpieces of this period is the depiction of an amateur performance by children of John Dryden's The Indian Emperour ,  or The Conquest of Mexico by Spaniards ,  being the Sequel of The Indian Queen (1732–1735) at the home of John Conduitt ,  master of the mint ,  in St George's Street ,  Hanover Square . Hogarth's other works in the 1730s include A Midnight Modern Conversation (1733) ,  Southwark Fair (1733) ,  The Sleeping Congregation (1736) ,  Before and After (1736) ,  Scholars at a Lecture (1736) ,  The Company of Undertakers (Consultation of Quacks) (1736) ,  The Distrest Poet (1736) ,  The Four Times of the Day (1738) ,  and Strolling Actresses Dressing in a Barn (1738) .  He might also have printed Burlington Gate (1731) ,  evoked by Alexander Pope's Epistle to Lord Burlington ,  and defending Lord Chandos ,  who is therein satirized .  This print gave great offence ,  and was suppressed .  However ,  modern authorities such as Ronald Paulson no longer attribute it to Hogarth . In 1731 ,  Hogarth completed the earliest of his series of moral works ,  a body of work that led to significant recognition .  The collection of six scenes was entitled A Harlot's Progress and appeared first as paintings (now lost)The inaugural series was an immediate success and was followed in 1733–1735 by the sequel A Rake's Progress . When the success of A Harlot's Progress and A Rake's Progress resulted in numerous pirated reproductions by unscrupulous printsellers ,  Hogarth lobbied in parliament for greater legal control over the reproduction of his and other artists' work .  The result was the Engravers' Copyright Act (known as 'Hogarth's Act') ,  which became law on 25 June 1735 and was the first copyright law to deal with visual works as well as the first to recognise the authorial rights of an individual artist . In 1743–1745 ,  Hogarth painted the six pictures of Marriage A-la-Mode (National Gallery ,  London) ,  a pointed skewering of upper-class 18th-century society .  This moralistic warning shows the miserable tragedy of an ill-considered marriage for money .  This is regarded by many as his finest project and may be among his best-planned story serials . Marital ethics were the topic of much debate in 18th-century Britain .  The many marriages of convenience and their attendant unhappiness came in for particular criticism ,  with a variety of authors taking the view that love was a much sounder basis for marriage .  Hogarth here painted a satire – a genre that by definition has a moral point to convey – of a conventional marriage within the English upper class .  All the paintings were engraved and the series achieved wide circulation in print form .  The series ,  which is set in a Classical interior ,  shows the story of the fashionable marriage of Viscount Squanderfield ,  the son of bankrupt Earl Squander ,  to the daughter of a wealthy but miserly city merchant ,  starting with the signing of a marriage contract at the Earl's grand house and ending with the murder of the son by his wife's lover and the suicide of the daughter after her lover is hanged at Tyburn for murdering her husband . William Makepeace Thackeray wrote :  This famous set of pictures contains the most important and highly wrought of the Hogarth comedies .  The care and method with which the moral grounds of these pictures are laid is as remarkable as the wit and skill of the observing and dexterous artist .  He has to describe the negotiations for a marriage pending between the daughter of a rich citizen Alderman and young Lord Viscount Squanderfield ,  the dissipated son of a gouty old Earl  .  .  .  The dismal end is known .  My lord draws upon the counsellor ,  who kills him ,  and is apprehended while endeavouring to escape .  My lady goes back perforce to the Alderman of the City ,  and faints upon reading Counsellor Silvertongue's dying speech at Tyburn (place of execution in old London) ,  where the counsellor has been 'executed for sending his lordship out of the world .  Moral :  don't listen to evil silver-tongued counsellors ;  don't marry a man for his rank ,  or a woman for her money ;  don't frequent foolish auctions and masquerade balls unknown to your husband ;  don't have wicked companions abroad and neglect your wife ,  otherwise you will be run through the body ,  and ruin will ensue ,  and disgrace ,  and Tyburn . In the twelve prints of Industry and Idleness (1747) ,  Hogarth shows the progression in the lives of two apprentices ,  one of whom is dedicated and hard working ,  while the other ,  who is idle ,  commits crime and is eventually executed .  This shows the work ethic of Protestant England ,  where those who worked hard were rewarded ,  such as the industrious apprentice who becomes Sheriff (plate 8) ,  Alderman (plate 10) ,  and finally the Lord Mayor of London in the last plate in the series .  The idle apprentice ,  who begins ""at play in the church yard"" (plate 3) ,  holes up ""in a Garrett with a Common Prostitute"" after turning highwayman (plate 7) and ""executed at Tyburn"" (plate 11) .  The idle apprentice is sent to the gallows by the industrious apprentice himself .  For each plate ,  there is at least one passage from the Bible at the bottom ,  mostly from the Book of Proverbs ,  such as for the first plate : Later prints of significance include his pictorial warning of the consequences of alcoholism in Beer Street and Gin Lane (1751) . In Beer Street ,  people are shown as healthy ,  happy and prosperous ,  while in Gin Lane ,  they are scrawny ,  lazy and careless .  The woman at the front of Gin Lane ,  who lets her baby fall to its death ,  echoes the tale of Judith Dufour ,  who strangled her baby so she could sell its clothes for gin money .  The prints were published in support of the Gin Act 1751 . Hogarth's friend ,  the magistrate Henry Fielding ,  may have enlisted Hogarth to help with propaganda for the Gin Act ;  Beer Street and Gin Lane were issued shortly after his work An Enquiry into the Causes of the Late Increase of Robbers ,  and Related Writings ,  and addressed the same issues . Other prints were his outcry against inhumanity in The Four Stages of Cruelty (published 21 February 1751) ,  in which Hogarth depicts the cruel treatment of animals which he saw around him and suggests what will happen to people who carry on in this manner .  In the first print ,  there are scenes of boys torturing dogs ,  cats and other animals .  It centers around a poorly dressed boy committing a  violent act of torture upon a dog ,  while being pleaded with to stop ,  and offered food ,  by another well-dressed boy .  A boy behind them has graffitied a hanged stickman figure upon a wall ,  with the name ""Tom Nero"" underneath ,  and is pointing to this dog torturer . The second shows Tom Nero has grown up to become a Hackney coach driver .  His coach has overturned with a heavy load and his horse is lying on the ground ,  having broken its leg .  He is beating it with the handle of his whip ;  its eye severely wounded .  Other people around him are seen abusing their work animals and livestock ,  and a child is being run over by the wheel of a dray ,  as the drayman dozes off on the job . In the third print ,  Tom is shown to be a murderer ,  surrounded by a mob of accusers .  The woman he has apparently killed is lying on the ground ,  brutally slain ,  with a trunk and sack of stolen goods near by .  One of the accusers holds a letter from the woman to Tom ,  speaking of how wronging her mistress upsets her conscience ,  but that she is resolved to do as he would have her ,  closing with :  ""I remain yours till death . ""The fourth ,  titled The Reward of Cruelty ,  shows Tom's withering corpse being publicly dissected by scientists after his execution by hanging ;  a noose still around his neck .  The dissection reflects the Murder Act 1751 ,  which allowed for the public dissection of criminals who had been hanged for murder . Hogarth was also popular portrait painter .  In 1745 ,  he painted actor David Garrick as Richard III , In 1740 ,  may be called masterpieces of British painting .  There are also portraits of his wife ,  his two sisters ,  and of many other people ;  among them Bishop Hoadly and Bishop Herring . For a long period ,  during the mid-18th century ,  Hogarth tried to achieve the status of a history painter ,  but did not earn much respect in this field .  The painter ,  and later founder of the Royal Academy of Arts ,  Joshua Reynolds ,  was highly critical of Hogarth's style and work .  According to art history professor ,  David Bindman ,  in Dr Johnson's serial of essays for London's Universal Chronicle ,  The Idler ,  the three essays written by Reynolds for the months of September through November 1759 are directed at Hogarth .  In them ,  Reynolds argues that this ""connoisseur"" has a ""servile attention to minute exactness"" and questions their idea of the imitation of nature as ""the obvious sense ,  that objects are represented naturally when they have such relief that they seem real . "" Reynolds rejected ""this kind of imitation"" ,  favouring the ""grand style of painting"" which avoids ""minute attention"" to the visible world . Writer ,  art historian and politician ,  Horace Walpole ,  was also critical of Hogarth as a history painter ,  but did find value in his satirical prints . Hogarth's history pictures include The Pool of Bethesda and The Good Samaritan ,  executed in 1736–1737 for St Bartholomew's Hospital ; The Gate of Calais (1748 ;  now in Tate Britain) was produced soon after his return from a visit to France .  Horace Walpole wrote that Hogarth had run a great risk to go there since the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle :  he went to France ,  and was so imprudent as to be taking a sketch of the drawbridge at Calais .  He was seized and carried to the governor ,  where he was forced to prove his vocation by producing several caricatures of the French ;  particularly a scene of the shore ,  with an immense piece of beef landing for the Lion d'argent ,  the English inn at Calais ,  and several hungry friars following it .  They were much diverted with his drawings ,  and dismissed him . Back home ,  he immediately executed a painting of the subject in which he unkindly represented his enemies ,  the Frenchmen ,  as cringing ,  emaciated and superstitious people ,  while an enormous sirloin of beef arrives ,  destined for the English inn as a symbol of British prosperity and superiority .  He claimed to have painted himself into the picture in the left corner sketching the gate ,  with a ""soldier's hand upon my shoulder"" ,  running him in . Notable Hogarth engravings in the 1740s include The Enraged Musician (1741) ,  the six prints of Marriage à-la-mode (1745 ;  executed by French artists under Hogarth's inspection) ,  and The Stage Coach or The Country Inn Yard (1747) . In 1745 ,  Hogarth painted a self-portrait with his pug dog ,  Trump (now also in Tate Britain) ,  which shows him as a learned artist supported by volumes of Shakespeare ,  Milton and Swift . Others works included his ingenious Satire on False Perspective (1754) ; In 1757 ,  Hogarth was appointed Serjeant Painter to the King . Hogarth wrote and published his ideas of artistic design in his book The Analysis of Beauty (1753) . Hogarth lived in an age when artwork became increasingly commercialized ,  being viewed in shop windows ,  taverns ,  and public buildings ,  and sold in printshops .  Old hierarchies broke down ,  and new forms began to flourish :  the ballad opera ,  the bourgeois tragedy ,  and especially ,  a new form of fiction called the novel with which authors such as Henry Fielding had great success .  Therefore ,  by that time ,  Hogarth hit on a new idea :  ""painting and engraving modern moral subjects  .  .  .  to treat my subjects as a dramatic writer ;  my picture was my stage"" ,  as he himself remarked in his manuscript notes . He drew from the highly moralizing Protestant tradition of Dutch genre painting ,  and the very vigorous satirical traditions of the English broadsheet and other types of popular print .  In England the fine arts had little comedy in them before Hogarth .  His prints were expensive ,  and remained so until early 19th-century reprints brought them to a wider audience . When analysing the work of the artist as a whole ,  Ronald Paulson says ,  ""In A Harlot's Progress ,  every single plate but one is based on Dürer's images of the story of the Virgin and the story of the Passion . "" In other works ,  he parodies Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper .  According to Paulson ,  Hogarth is subverting the religious establishment and the orthodox belief in an immanent God who intervenes in the lives of people and produces miracles .  Indeed ,  Hogarth was a Deist ,  a believer in a God who created the universe but takes no direct hand in the lives of his creations .  Thus ,  as a ""comic history painter"" ,  he often poked fun at the old-fashioned ,  ""beaten"" subjects of religious art in his paintings and prints .  Hogarth also rejected Lord Shaftesbury's then-current ideal of the classical Greek male in favour of the living ,  breathing female .  He said ,  ""Who but a bigot ,  even to the antiques ,  will say that he has not seen faces and necks ,  hands and arms in living women ,  that even the Grecian Venus doth but coarsely imitate . "" On 25 October 1764 ,  Hogarth was conveyed from his villa in Chiswick to his home in Leicester Fields ,  in weak condition .  He had been in a weakened state for a while by this time ,  but was said to be in a cheerful mood and was even still working—with some help ;  doing more retouches on The Bench on this same day . Mrs Lewis ,  who stayed on with Jane Hogarth in Leicester Fields , Hogarth was buried at St .  Nicholas Church ,  Chiswick ,  now in the west of London . Farewell great Painter of MankindWho reach'd the noblest point of ArtWhose pictur'd Morals charm the MindAnd through the Eye correct the Heart . If Genius fire thee ,  Reader ,  stay , If Nature touch thee ,  drop a Tear : If neither move thee ,  turn away , For Hogarth's honour'd dust lies here .  "

1195,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Petr_Pavlensky,Petr_Pavlensky,Political_artists,"   Pavlensky and Oksana Shalygina founded an independent online newspaper Political Propaganda in 2012 ,  which was dedicated to contemporary art in political contexts ,  ""overcoming cultural chauvinism ,  implemented by the government"" ,  feminism and gender equality . Pavlensky first became known for sewing his mouth shut in political art event against the incarceration of members of the Russian punk group Pussy Riot . Seam is said to reference David Wojnarowicz's actions in Rosa von Praunheim's documentary Silence = Death (1990) , On November 14 ,  2012 ,  Reuters published its list of the 98 best photos of the year which included Seam . On May 3 ,  2013 ,  Pavlensky held a political art event in which he wanted to show the existence of a person inside a repressive legal system . Pavlensky made the following comment about his art work : A series of laws aimed at suppressing civic activism ,  intimidation of the population ,  steadily growing number of political prisoners ,  the laws against NGOs ,  the 18+ laws ,  censorship laws ,  activity of Federal Service for Supervision of Communications ,  Information Technology and Mass Media ,  ""promotion of homosexuality"" laws  – all these laws aren't aimed against criminals ,  but against the people .  And at last the Blasphemy law .  That is why I organized this action .  The human body is naked like a carcass ,  there is nothing on it except the barbed wire ,  which by the way was invented for the protection of livestock .  These laws like the wire ,  keep people in individual pens :  all this persecution of political activists ,  ""prisoners of May ,  6"" ,  governmental repressions is the metaphor of the pen with the barbed wire around it .  All this has been done in order to turn people into gutless and securely guarded cattle ,  which can only consume ,  work ,  and reproduce .  :  Dmitry Volchek ,  ""Cultural Diary :  On Good Friday » ,  Radio Liberty ,  May 8 ,  2013On November 10 ,  2013 ,  while sitting naked on the stone pavement in front of Lenin's Mausoleum on the Red Square ,  Moscow ,  Pavlensky hammered a large nail through his scrotum ,  affixing it to the stone pavement .  His political art event coincided with the annual Russian Police Day .  When the police arrived ,  they covered him with a blanket and later arrested him . ""A naked artist ,  looking at his testicles nailed to the cobblestone is a metaphor of apathy ,  political indifference ,  and fatalism of Russian society , "" declared Pavlensky in his statement to the media . On February 23 ,  2014 ,  Pavlensky organized an event called Freedom inspired by Maidan and the 2014 Ukrainian revolution . On February 25 ,  2014 ,  Dzerzhinsky Criminal Court stopped the administrative case against Pavlensky on the accusations of hooliganism ,  and released him from custody .  An investigation into Pavlensky's alleged violation of the regulations on political meetings continued .  The transcript of the conversations was published as the Dialogues on art in several countries . On October 19 ,  2014 ,  Pavlensky cut off his earlobe with a chef's knife while sitting naked on the roof of the infamous Serbsky Center to make visible political abuse of psychiatry in Russia . Pavlensky came to the first entrance of the Lubyanka Building ,  which is the headquarters of the Russian Federal Security Service ,  on November 9 ,  2015 at 1 : 15a . m .  Moscow time ,  doused the front door with gasoline ,  and set fire to it with a cigarette lighter .  The doors of the building were partially burnt .  Pavlensky stood and waited to be arrested ,  was detained after 30 seconds without resistance ,  and was charged with debauchery .  A few hours after the event ,  a video appeared on the Internet with an explanation of the meaning of the burning . The criminal case against Pavlensky was opened on November 9 ,  2015 under the ""vandalism"" section of Article 214 of the Russian criminal code .  He was held in a psychiatric ward for a few weeks ,  and spent seven months in prison waiting for his trial . According to gallerist Marat Gelman ,  the action shows Pavlensky's ""obvious symbolism"" .  ""The Lubyanka door is the gate of hell ,  the entrance into the world of absolute evil .  And against the backdrop of hellfire is a lonely artist ,  waiting to be captured  .  .  .  Pavlensky's figure at the door of the FSB in flames - very important symbol for today's Russia ,  both political and artistic . ""On 8 June 2016 ,  the Moscow criminal court declared Pavlensky guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to a fine of 500 , 000 rubles ,  which Pavlensky refused to pay . On 13 August 2016 ,  Pavlensky gave a lecture in Odessa ,  Ukraine which ended with the inebriated Ukrainian journalist and screenwriter Vladimir Nestrenko instigating a fight that ended with his stabbing one of two security guards who tried to subdue him .  The second of the two security guards suffered a fatal heart attack after the incident . On 16 October 2017 ,  in his first political art event outside of Russia ,  Pavlensky was arrested in Paris after setting fire to the street-level windows of an office of the Bank of France ,  located on the Place de la Bastille in Paris . On 10 January 2019 ,  Pavlensky was sentenced to three years in prison ;  his pre-trial detention was counted as time served and the remaining two years were suspended .  Shalygina was sentenced to two years in prison ,  of which 16 months were spent on probation .  In addition ,  the convicts are obliged to pay the Bank of France €18 , 678 as compensation for material damage and €3 , 000 for moral damage .  According to the newspaper Le Matin ,  Pavlensky in response shouted in Russian ""Never!"" . In 2020 ,  Pavlensky innovated with a new political art event called ""Pornopolitics"" for which he launched a website presented as ""the first political porn platform"" . On February 12 ,  the artist published intimate videos and sexually connoted messages sent by the deputy and Paris mayoral candidate Benjamin Griveaux to a woman .  Pavlensky explained that this material demonstrates ""the hypocrisy"" of the candidate who campaigned by putting forward ""traditional family values"" . Pavlensky was arrested and placed in police custody with his partner Alexandra de Taddeo who was the recipient of the sexually explicit content .   "

1198,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Pablo_Picasso,Pablo_Picasso,Political_artists," Picasso was born at 23 : 15 on 25 October 1881 ,  in the city of Málaga ,  Andalusia ,  in southern Spain .  Ruiz's ancestors were minor aristocrats . Picasso's birth certificate and the record of his baptism include very long names ,  combining those of various saints and relatives . Picasso showed a passion and a skill for drawing from an early age .  According to his mother ,  his first words were ""piz ,  piz"" ,  a shortening of lápiz ,  the Spanish word for ""pencil"" .  From the age of seven ,  Picasso received formal artistic training from his father in figure drawing and oil painting .  Ruiz was a traditional academic artist and instructor ,  who believed that proper training required disciplined copying of the masters ,  and drawing the human body from plaster casts and live models .  His son became preoccupied with art to the detriment of his classwork . The family moved to A Coruña in 1891 ,  where his father became a professor at the School of Fine Arts .  They stayed almost four years .  On one occasion ,  the father found his son painting over his unfinished sketch of a pigeon .  Observing the precision of his son's technique ,  an apocryphal story relates ,  Ruiz felt that the thirteen-year-old Picasso had surpassed him ,  and vowed to give up painting ,  though paintings by him exist from later years . In 1895 ,  Picasso was traumatized when his seven-year-old sister ,  Conchita ,  died of diphtheria . Picasso's father and uncle decided to send the young artist to Madrid's Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando ,  the country's foremost art school .   Picasso's training under his father began before 1890 .  His progress can be traced in the collection of early works now held by the Museu Picasso in Barcelona ,  which provides one of the most comprehensive records extant of any major artist's beginnings . In 1897 ,  his realism began to show a Symbolist influence ,  for example ,  in a series of landscape paintings rendered in non-naturalistic violet and green tones .  What some call his Modernist period (1899–1900) followed .  His exposure to the work of Rossetti ,  Steinlen ,  Toulouse-Lautrec and Edvard Munch ,  combined with his admiration for favourite old masters such as El Greco ,  led Picasso to a personal version of modernism in his works of this period . Picasso made his first trip to Paris ,  then the art capital of Europe ,  in 1900 .  There ,  he met his first Parisian friend ,  journalist and poet Max Jacob ,  who helped Picasso learn the language and its literature .  Soon they shared an apartment ;  Max slept at night while Picasso slept during the day and worked at night .  These were times of severe poverty ,  cold ,  and desperation .  Much of his work was burned to keep the small room warm .  During the first five months of 1901 ,  Picasso lived in Madrid ,  where he and his anarchist friend Francisco de Asís Soler founded the magazine Arte Joven (Young Art) ,  which published five issues .  Soler solicited articles and Picasso illustrated the journal ,  mostly contributing grim cartoons depicting and sympathizing with the state of the poor .  The first issue was published on 31 March 1901 ,  by which time the artist had started to sign his work Picasso . Picasso's Blue Period (1901–1904) ,  characterized by sombre paintings rendered in shades of blue and blue-green only occasionally warmed by other colours ,  began either in Spain in early 1901 or in Paris in the second half of the year . The same mood pervades the well-known etching The Frugal Repast (1904) ,  which depicts a blind man and a sighted woman ,  both emaciated ,  seated at a nearly bare table .  Blindness ,  a recurrent theme in Picasso's works of this period ,  is also represented in The Blindman's Meal (1903 ,  the Metropolitan Museum of Art) and in the portrait of Celestina (1903) .  Other Blue Period works include Portrait of Soler and Portrait of Suzanne Bloch . The Rose Period (1904–1906) Olivier appears in many of his Rose Period paintings ,  many of which are influenced by his warm relationship with her ,  in addition to his increased exposure to French painting .  The generally upbeat and optimistic mood of paintings in this period is reminiscent of the 1899–1901 period (i . e .  ,  just prior to the Blue Period) ,  and 1904 can be considered a transition year between the two periods . By 1905 ,  Picasso became a favourite of American art collectors Leo and Gertrude Stein .  Their older brother Michael Stein and his wife Sarah also became collectors of his work .  Picasso painted a portrait of Gertrude Stein and one of her nephew Allan Stein .  Gertrude Stein became Picasso's principal patron ,  acquiring his drawings and paintings and exhibiting them in her informal Salon at her home in Paris . In 1907 ,  Picasso joined an art gallery that had recently been opened in Paris by Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler ,  a German art historian and art collector who became one of the premier French art dealers of the 20th century .  He was among the first champions of Pablo Picasso ,  Georges Braque and the Cubism that they jointly developed .  Kahnweiler promoted burgeoning artists such as André Derain ,  Kees van Dongen ,  Fernand Léger ,  Juan Gris ,  Maurice de Vlaminck and several others who had come from all over the globe to live and work in Montparnasse at the time . Picasso's African-influenced Period (1907–1909) begins with his painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon .  The three figures on the left were inspired by Iberian sculpture ,  but he repainted the faces of the two figures on the right after being powerfully impressed by African artefacts he saw in June 1907 in the ethnographic museum at Palais du Trocadéro .  Picasso did not exhibit Les Demoiselles publicly until 1916 . Other works from this period include Nude with Raised Arms (1907) and Three Women (1908) .  Formal ideas developed during this period lead directly into the Cubist period that follows . Analytic cubism (1909–1912) is a style of painting Picasso developed with Georges Braque using monochrome brownish and neutral colours .  Both artists took apart objects and ""analyzed"" them in terms of their shapes .  Picasso and Braque's paintings at this time share many similarities . In Paris ,  Picasso entertained a distinguished coterie of friends in the Montmartre and Montparnasse quarters ,  including André Breton ,  poet Guillaume Apollinaire ,  writer Alfred Jarry and Gertrude Stein .  In 1911 ,  Picasso was arrested and questioned about the theft of the Mona Lisa from the Louvre .  Suspicion for the crime had initially fallen upon Apollinaire due to his links to Géry Pieret ,  an artist with a history of thefts from the gallery .  Apollinaire in turn implicated his close friend Picasso ,  who had also purchased stolen artworks from the artist in the past .  Afraid of a conviction that could result in his deportation to Spain ,  Picasso denied having ever met Apollinaire .  Both were later cleared of any involvement in the painting's disappearance . Synthetic cubism (1912–1919) was a further development of the genre of cubism ,  in which cut paper fragments– often wallpaper or portions of newspaper pages– were pasted into compositions ,  marking the first use of collage in fine art . Between 1915 and 1917 ,  Picasso began a series of paintings depicting highly geometric and minimalist Cubist objects ,  consisting of either a pipe ,  a guitar or a glass ,  with an occasional element of collage .  ""Hard-edged square-cut diamonds"" ,  notes art historian John Richardson ,  ""these gems do not always have upside or downside"" . After acquiring some fame and fortune ,  Picasso left Olivier for Marcelle Humbert ,  whom he called Eva Gouel .  Picasso included declarations of his love for Eva in many Cubist works .  Picasso was devastated by her premature death from illness at the age of 30 in 1915 . At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 ,  Picasso was living in Avignon .  Braque and Derain were mobilized and Apollinaire joined the French artillery ,  while the Spaniard Juan Gris remained from the Cubist circle .  During the war ,  Picasso was able to continue painting uninterrupted ,  unlike his French comrades .  His paintings became more sombre and his life changed with dramatic consequences .  Kahnweiler's contract had terminated on his exile from France .  At this point Picasso's work would be taken on by the art dealer Léonce Rosenberg .  After the loss of Eva Gouel ,  Picasso had an affair with Gaby Lespinasse .  During the spring of 1916 ,  Apollinaire returned from the front wounded .  They renewed their friendship ,  but Picasso began to frequent new social circles . Towards the end of World War I ,  Picasso became involved with Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes .  Among his friends during this period were Jean Cocteau ,  Jean Hugo ,  Juan Gris ,  and others .  In the summer of 1918 ,  Picasso married Olga Khokhlova ,  a ballerina with Sergei Diaghilev's troupe ,  for whom Picasso was designing a ballet ,  Erik Satie's Parade ,  in Rome ;  they spent their honeymoon near Biarritz in the villa of glamorous Chilean art patron Eugenia Errázuriz . After returning from his honeymoon and in need of money ,  Picasso started his exclusive relationship with the French-Jewish art dealer Paul Rosenberg .  As part of his first duties ,  Rosenberg agreed to rent the couple an apartment in Paris at his own expense ,  which was located next to his own house .  This was the start of a deep brother-like friendship between two very different men ,  that would last until the outbreak of World War II . Khokhlova introduced Picasso to high society ,  formal dinner parties ,  and other dimensions of the life of the rich in 1920s Paris .  The two had a son ,  Paulo Picasso , In 1927 ,  Picasso met 17-year-old Marie-Thérèse Walter and began a secret affair with her .  Picasso's marriage to Khokhlova soon ended in separation rather than divorce ,  as French law required an even division of property in the case of divorce ,  and Picasso did not want Khokhlova to have half his wealth .  The two remained legally married until Khokhlova's death in 1955 .  Picasso carried on a long-standing affair with Marie-Thérèse Walter and fathered a daughter with her ,  named Maya .  Marie-Thérèse lived in the vain hope that Picasso would one day marry her ,  and hanged herself four years after Picasso's death . 1909 ,  Femme assise (Sitzende Frau) ,  oil on canvas ,  100 × 80cm (39 x 31 in) ,  Staatliche Museen ,  Neue Nationalgalerie ,  Berlin1909–10 ,  Figure dans un Fauteuil (Seated Nude ,  Femme nue assise) ,  oil on canvas ,  92 . 1 × 73cm (36 x 28 in) ,  Tate Modern ,  London .

The work is the largest of Picasso's paintings .  Centre Pompidou-Metz ,  Metz ,  France ,  May 2012In February 1917 ,  Picasso made his first trip to Italy .  In the period following the upheaval of World War I ,  Picasso produced work in a neoclassical style .  This ""return to order"" is evident in the work of many European artists in the 1920s ,  including André Derain ,  Giorgio de Chirico ,  Gino Severini ,  Jean Metzinger ,  the artists of the New Objectivity movement and of the Novecento Italiano movement .  Picasso's paintings and drawings from this period frequently recall the work of Raphael and Ingres . In 1925 the Surrealist writer and poet André Breton declared Picasso as 'one of ours' in his article Le Surréalisme et la peinture ,  published in Révolution surréaliste .  Les Demoiselles was reproduced for the first time in Europe in the same issue .  Yet Picasso exhibited Cubist works at the first Surrealist group exhibition in 1925 ;  the concept of 'psychic automatism in its pure state' defined in the Manifeste du surréalisme never appealed to him entirely .  He did at the time develop new imagery and formal syntax for expressing himself emotionally ,  ""releasing the violence ,  the psychic fears and the eroticism that had been largely contained or sublimated since 1909"" ,  writes art historian Melissa McQuillan .

His use of the minotaur came partly from his contact with the surrealists ,  who often used it as their symbol ,  and it appears in Picasso's Guernica .  The minotaur and Picasso's mistress Marie-Thérèse Walter are heavily featured in his celebrated Vollard Suite of etchings . Arguably Picasso's most famous work is his depiction of the German bombing of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War – Guernica .  This large canvas embodies for many the inhumanity ,  brutality and hopelessness of war .  Asked to explain its symbolism ,  Picasso said ,  ""It isn't up to the painter to define the symbols .  Otherwise it would be better if he wrote them out in so many words! The public who look at the picture must interpret the symbols as they understand them . "" Guernica was exhibited in July 1937 at the Spanish Pavilion at the Paris International Exposition ,  and then became the centerpiece of an exhibition of 118 works by Picasso ,  Matisse ,  Braque and Henri Laurens that toured Scandinavia and England .  After the victory of Francisco Franco in Spain ,  the painting was sent to the United States to raise funds and support for Spanish refugees .  Until 1981 it was entrusted to the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City ,  as it was Picasso's expressed desire that the painting should not be delivered to Spain until liberty and democracy had been established in the country . In 1939 and 1940 ,  the Museum of Modern Art in New York City ,  under its director Alfred Barr ,  a Picasso enthusiast ,  held a major retrospective of Picasso's principal works until that time .  This exhibition lionized Picasso ,  brought into full public view in America the scope of his artistry ,  and resulted in a reinterpretation of his work by contemporary art historians and scholars . During World War II ,  Picasso remained in Paris while the Germans occupied the city .  Picasso's artistic style did not fit the Nazi ideal of art ,  so he did not exhibit during this time .  He was often harassed by the Gestapo .  During one search of his apartment ,  an officer saw a photograph of the painting Guernica .  ""Did you do that?"" the German asked Picasso .  ""No , "" he replied ,  ""You did . ""Retreating to his studio ,  he continued to paint ,  producing works such as the Still Life with Guitar (1942) and The Charnel House (1944–48) . Around this time ,  Picasso wrote poetry as an alternative outlet .  Between 1935 and 1959 he wrote over 300 poems .  Largely untitled except for a date and sometimes the location of where it was written (for example ""Paris 16 May 1936"") ,  these works were gustatory ,  erotic ,  and at times scatological ,  as were his two full-length plays ,  Desire Caught by the Tail (1941) ,  and The Four Little Girls (1949) . In 1944 ,  after the liberation of Paris ,  Picasso ,  then 63 years old ,  began a romantic relationship with a young art student named Françoise Gilot .  She was 40 years younger than he was .  Picasso grew tired of his mistress Dora Maar ;  Picasso and Gilot began to live together .  Eventually they had two children :  Claude Picasso ,  born in 1947 and Paloma Picasso ,  born in 1949 .  In her 1964 book Life with Picasso ,  Gilot describes his abusive treatment and myriad infidelities which led her to leave him ,  taking the children with her .  This was a severe blow to Picasso . Picasso had affairs with women of an even greater age disparity than his and Gilot's .  While still involved with Gilot ,  in 1951 Picasso had a six-week affair with Geneviève Laporte ,  who was four years younger than Gilot .  By his 70s ,  many paintings ,  ink drawings and prints have as their theme an old ,  grotesque dwarf as the doting lover of a beautiful young model .  Jacqueline Roque (1927–1986) worked at the Madoura Pottery in Vallauris on the French Riviera ,  where Picasso made and painted ceramics .  She became his lover ,  and then his second wife in 1961 .  The two were together for the remainder of Picasso's life . His marriage to Roque was also a means of revenge against Gilot ;  with Picasso's encouragement ,  Gilot had divorced her then husband ,  Luc Simon ,  with the plan to marry Picasso to secure the rights of her children as Picasso's legitimate heirs .  Picasso had already secretly married Roque ,  after Gilot had filed for divorce .  His strained relationship with Claude and Paloma was never healed . By this time ,  Picasso had constructed a huge Gothic home ,  and could afford large villas in the south of France ,  such as Mas Notre-Dame-de-Vie on the outskirts of Mougins ,  and in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur .  He was an international celebrity ,  with often as much interest in his personal life as his art . Picasso was one of 250 sculptors who exhibited in the 3rd Sculpture International held at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in mid-1949 .  In the 1950s ,  Picasso's style changed once again ,  as he took to producing reinterpretations of the art of the great masters .  He made a series of works based on Velázquez's painting of Las Meninas .  He also based paintings on works by Goya ,  Poussin ,  Manet ,  Courbet and Delacroix . In addition to his artistic accomplishments ,  Picasso made a few film appearances ,  always as himself ,  including a cameo in Jean Cocteau's Testament of Orpheus (1960) .  In 1955 ,  he helped make the film Le Mystère Picasso (The Mystery of Picasso) directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot . He was commissioned to make a maquette for a huge 50-foot (15m)-high public sculpture to be built in Chicago ,  known usually as the Chicago Picasso .  He approached the project with a great deal of enthusiasm ,  designing a sculpture which was ambiguous and somewhat controversial .  What the figure represents is not known ;  it could be a bird ,  a horse ,  a woman or a totally abstract shape .  The sculpture ,  one of the most recognizable landmarks in downtown Chicago ,  was unveiled in 1967 .  Picasso refused to be paid $100 , 000 for it ,  donating it to the people of the city . Picasso's final works were a mixture of styles ,  his means of expression in constant flux until the end of his life .  Devoting his full energies to his work ,  Picasso became more daring ,  his works more colourful and expressive ,  and from 1968 to 1971 he produced a torrent of paintings and hundreds of copperplate etchings .  At the time these works were dismissed by most as pornographic fantasies of an impotent old man or the slapdash works of an artist who was past his prime . Pablo Picasso died on 8 April 1973 in Mougins ,  France ,  from pulmonary edema and heart failure ,  while he and his wife Jacqueline entertained friends for dinner .  He was interred at the Château of Vauvenargues near Aix-en-Provence ,  a property he had acquired in 1958 and occupied with Jacqueline between 1959 and 1962 .  Jacqueline prevented his children Claude and Paloma from attending the funeral .   "

1217,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Mel_Zabarsky,Mel_Zabarsky,Political_artists,"   From the late 1950s to the mid-1970s ,  Zabarsky's paintings featured political themes ,  semi-realist portraiture and stylized trompe l'oeil geometric backgrounds .  Typically spotlighting cultural figures ,  such as Che Guevara in The Argentinian Cyclist (1969–70)By the 1970s ,  Zabarsky's geometry began to look more like still life ,  his palette lightened and edges softened .  The eponymous Teeth on a Pedestal (1974) is one of several Dada or Absurdist pieces from this period ,  glorifying in teeth ,  or dentures ,  often posed beside a model of a muscular man . A Spanish sabbatical in the mid-80s moved Zabarsky toward more traditional European narrative styles . From 1999-2009 ,  Zabarsky explored the Jewish self and the American and European other in the collection Surreal Histories .  The collection distills themes into both a straightforward “public history” of Ernest and Pauline Hemingway in Spain after the Spanish Civil War in Spanish Panorama (Hemingway’s Version) and the idiosyncratic “personal history” Oslo Sun and Vienna Moon .  The latter features bursts of bright color and a bold off-center composition that spans Edvard Munch’s The Scream ,  Sigmund and Anna Freud and the painter Balthus smashing through rich blues ,  crimsons ,  violets and sunny yellows to cross cultures ,  types and textures all gently bound together by the scrawled word “contemporaries . ”Also an educator ,  Zabarsky taught art for nearly three decades at various institutions including the Swain School of Design ,   "
1218,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Tavar_Zawacki,Tavar_Zawacki,Political_artists,"   Tavar Zawacki was born in the foothills of Northern California in 1981 from two creative hippie parents who invented his name . During a six-year period from 2000–06 ,  Tavar's artist focus was exclusively on the 'ABOVE' arrow icon he invented . In the summer of 2004 ,  Zawacki went on a self-titled ""U . S . A .  Tour"" .  He drove 5 , 000 miles (8 , 000km) across the United States hanging 300 plus arrow mobiles in 14 major cities . Zawacki returned to Europe in 2005 .  When asked in an interview why he did not hang his arrow mobiles in Europe after his U . S . A .  tour ,  he responded ,  ""In the United States there is an almost infinite amount of overhead telephone wires and street cables .  However ,  I was unsure if the different European countries had many overhead wires like in the United States? I decided instead to make wooden arrows that were able to adhere to the sides of buildings ,  at elevated heights .  During my travels around Europe ,  I was able to in fact see that most of the countries I visited had overhead wires to support the future hanging of my arrow mobiles . ""In 2006 ,  Tavar began planning a new tour which he titled the 'Sign Language Tour' .  By his own reports ,  he counterfeited Eurail tickets for a six-month duration ,  spanning 26 countries around Europe . In 2007 ,  Tavar expanded from the wordplay of the previous year's 'Sign Language' tour around Europe .  His 2007 South ,  and Central America tour was focused on painting larger wordplay murals on the exterior of building facades .  He said in an interview ,  ""I wanted to return to painting letters ,  like the traditional graffiti I did when I was younger ,  but instead of painting my graffiti name ,  I wanted to paint word-based art that was site specific and could easily be read and understood . 2008 was the start of another new chapter in Tavar Zawacki's career .  While still using his street moniker ,  ABOVE ,  Tavar had abandoned his previous year's focus of the arrow icon ,  and started painting site-specific figurative stencil works that often had a statement of social and or political awareness . In September 2008 ,  Zawacki traveled to Lisbon ,  Portugal ,  where he painted his ""Giving to the poor"" stencil commenting on the social issue of homelessness .  He stated ,  ""Every day I walked by this bank ATM machine and this particular homeless woman was sitting in the same place every day begging for money .  I found it sadly ironic that just six feet away from here there were people lining up to withdraw money .  The sharp social and economic clash inspired me to make this piece . "" In October 2008 ,  Zawacki returned to California ,  when the New York Stock Exchange (NTSE) crashed ,  marking a worsening of the 2008 recession .  He stenciled on the exterior of a Washington Mutual building (one of several banks that collapsed during this period) an image of the NYSE bar graph with a downward sloping red line that went all the way down into the street gutter ,  mimicking the results that occurred just a few days before . In April 2009 ,  Zawacki created a stencil mural depicting four children searching for ""Easter AIGs"" in response to the breaking scandal surrounding American International Group and the degree to which it profited from 2008 bailout . In May 2009 ,  Zawacki started another tour of Europe lasting four months .  This tour did not seem to have a title ,  as with most of his previous tours .  In July ,  he painted a social and political stencil piece titled 'Bridging The Divide' directly on the Berlin Wall .  The artwork depicted a young girl jumping up ,  with arm extended trying to grab a bouquet of flowers from a person on the opposite side of the Berlin .  The painted scene was completed with a smiling guard looking at the young girl jumping .  'Bridging The Divide' was painted on the 20th anniversary of the German reunificationIn January 2010 ,  just days after the Haiti Earthquakes ,  Zawacki flew to La Havana ,  Cuba ,  to make a site-specific stencil commenting on the recent devastation in the neighboring country of Haiti .  His stencil work was titled 'Help Thy Neighbor' and depicted a young Cuban boy with tire raft ,  first aid medical kit ,  and a Haitian flag in hand ready to embark to what is assumed to be Haiti . Blek le Rat one of the first graffiti artists in Paris ,  and has been described as the ""Father of stencil graffiti"" . In a press release from White Walls gallery ,  ""The meeting of these two artists is a passing of the torch from the original stencil artist to a younger generation of urban artists following in his legacy .  Blek let Rat first pioneered stencils in the early 80s as a bold ,  attention-grabbing form of street art that was never before seen .  ABOVE is the prominent stencil artist of the new generation ,  drawing on Blek's methods to project a social message into the urban environment . In October at the height of the global Occupy Wall Street protest ,  Zawacki flew to Miami and painted a 120 foot (37m) long wordplay mural that read ""Give A Wall St .  Banker Enough Rope And He Will Hang Himself . "" Zawacki's mural incorporated a hanging effigy of a suited banker to the installation .  When NBC News did a news report on Tavar's ""Wall St . "" piece ,  he told the reporter ,  ""You don't have to read it ,  you just get it immediately when you see it .  It's extremely aggressive and that's actually the point . "" His final reply was ,  ""Everybody's entitled to their own opinion ,  and some people will praise it ,  others will deny it and criticize it ,  but the point being is that it's getting people talking about the movement . ""In February 2012 ,  Zawacki traveled to Johannesburg ,  South Africa ,  where he painted a mural commenting on the illegal blood diamond trade .  He appropriated the proverb 'Diamonds are a girl's best friend' and painted the message 'Diamonds are a woman's best friend and a man's worst enemy' on the exterior wall of Jewel City ,  one of the world's largest diamond exporters . The story of how Zawacki was able to trick the owners of Jewel city to paint such a large controversial statement on the exterior of their building without any trouble was ,  in the artist's words ,  a 'jewel heist' of his own . In September 2012 amidst the Eurozone financial crisis ,  Zawacki flew to Zaragoza ,  Spain .  He painted a 120 foot (37m) long stencil mural of a queue of silhouettes accompanied by the statement '24% Desempleados' ('24% unemployed' in English) that were waiting in line for the unemployment office .  This social ,  political ,  and time-sensitive mural addressed the hard financial times that Spain was facing with its highest unemployment rate in the world .  At the time that Zawacki painted this mural 24 . 6% of Spaniards were unemployed ;  for under-25-year-olds ,  53% were unemployed . In the same month of September ,  Zawacki went to Copenhagen ,  Denmark ,  to created a time-lapse film titled #Socialmedia .  He painted a message on the wall ,  then repainted the wall white ,  only to repaint a new message .  He repeated this process of painting new statements over a duration of two days . In August 2013 ,  Zawacki created a time-relative stencil titled 'Timing Is Everything' in London ,  England .  The colorful stencil painted on the side of a wall depicted a break dancer positioned upside down ,  with his arm extended downwards .  At night ,  the context of the stencil is 'activated' by the street light ,  thus creating a shadow of the nearby street pole directly onto the wall .  The stenciled breakdancer is now seen in a newer context of balancing himself on top of the street sign's shadow .  In an interview ,  Zawacki said ,  ""all of my stencil works exist in a site-specific context .  I have been searching for this fixed shadow in a high visibility location for the past eight months during my global travels .  I finally found the perfect shadow in Shoreditch area of London . ""According to Tavar ,  the main reason why 'the perfect shadow' was so challenging to find was because it needed to exist in a highly trafficked area of a major city . The majority of Zawacki's street works have topics of social or political issues suggested in the artworks .  During an interview ,  he commented ,  ""The Timing Is Everything stencil painted in London was void of any political or social message ,  but what it did have was an interaction with the city ,  and how things alter from day to night .  The stencil shows how timing and lighting can be the platform ,  as well as the inspiration for a piece of work . ""In June 2014 Zawacki was one of the international artists invited to paint at Artscape mural event held in the city of Malmö ,  Sweden . In September 2014 Zawacki had a three-month-long artist-in-residence run in Detroit ,  Michigan in preparation for his solo exhibition titled 'Remix' . In October 2015 Zawacki painted the largest mural of his career at that time ,  a 33-meter tall (108 feet) by 17-meter wide (55 feet) mural titled 'Incognito' in Johannesburg ,  South Africa as part of the City of Gold Festival . In March 2016 Zawacki ,  still using his moniker ,  'ABOVE' ,  had a solo exhibition in Zürich ,  Switzerland titled '12 Months' . In the summer of 2016 ,  Zawacki served as artist-in-residence of the Quin Arts program at the Quin Hotel in New York City ,  furthering his exploration of geometric abstractionIn January 2017 ,  Zawacki decided to step out of his self-imposed shadow of anonymity ,  and start creating ,  and signing his artworks with his real birth name – allowing more freedom of creative exploration ,  as well as freedom from the arrow icon he had formerly associated himself with .  He stated ,  'My decision suddenly liberated me ,  as well as opened up creative ideas to a seemingly unlimited expansion of new opportunities .  I see a new foundation to expand upon ,  free of any artistic restrictions ,  and my curiosity to push my creative limits to new ,  higher levels' . Zawacki debuted his museum-style solo exhibition titled ,  Metamorphosis in September 2017 ,  at Urban Spree Galerie in Berlin . Metamorphosis' entire body of work was painted on large format canvases ,  and profiled four different painting styles ,  Op-Art ,  Trompe-l'œil ,  CMYK and Hard-edge painting . In September Zawacki's second book ,  also titled Metamorphosis ,  was published .  Metamorphosis is a 168-page hardcover book covering his last 3 years of creative works ,  from his seminal 2014 Remix exhibition in Detroit to his latest and most ambitious show to date at Urban Spree Galerie in September 2017 .  The book covers all his outdoor murals during that period and illustrates how the artist navigates between his indoor and outdoor works and the influences thereof . In November 2018 ,  Zawacki presented his solo exhibition ,  Shapeshifting at Wunderkammern gallery in Milan ,  Italy .  For this occasion the artist has decided to reflect on the concept of metamorphosis intended in a personal and artistic sense ,  testing himself with the use of different types of shapes and colors . Artist Shepard Fairey wrote the introduction text for the Shapeshifting exhibition :  ""I have known Tavar Zawacki’s art for more than 15 years .  I initially knew him by his street name ,  'ABOVE' .  Tavar impressed me with his dedication to mastering the most essential aspects of street art :  widespread coverage ,  recognizable iconography ,  and impressive placements on the street in terms of risk and visual impact .  It seems to me that two years ago Tavar Zawacki had pushed his anonymous ABOVE concept to the pinnacle of what is possible and respected in the street art world ,  and decided it was time to expand his parameters and evolve ,  stepping into the sunlight by using his birth name and evolving away from just his long-present arrow icon .  However ,  Tavar did not abandon the fruits of his years of graphic mastery in form and color ,  he simply chose to apply them in broader ,  more ambitious ,  and more sophisticated ways . The recent works in the street and the studio leading up to his Shapeshifting exhibition are the most visually dynamic but seductive pieces of Tavar's career .  Sometimes the fundamental ingredients are there ,  but it takes the subtle moves to yield sublime alchemy .  Tavar’s newest works embody power and beauty in elegant harmony ,  but especially the pieces that utilize trompe-l'œil push beyond design-based art to create a provocatively surreal 2D/3D dialogue that distinguishes them .  Tavar’s 2D/3D dialogue extends to three-dimensional pieces using gradients to mimic light play on reflective surfaces and cast shadows .  Tavar has evolved and in the process developed a truly distinctive ,  powerful but luxurious ,  visual language . ""In September 2019 ,  Tavar was commissioned by one of the oldest public arts institutions in the United States , Tavar collaborated with Wilson football and the National Football League to create a design on 104 limited edition footballs for the Super Bowl LIV which took place on Monday ,  February 3 ,  2020 ,  in Miami ,  Florida . In February ,  2020 Tavar decided to leave his home in Berlin ,  Germany ,  and move to Bali ,  Indonesia .  After one month upon his arrival to Bali the Covid-19 global pandemic had spread ,  shutting down international travel as well as lockdown restrictions .  In March ,  2020 at the start of the lockdowns on the island of Bali ,  Tavar started to paint a new collection of paintings appropriately titled ,  Lockdown .  He is quoted as ,  'During the global pandemic of 2020 ,  I spent an average of 9-10 hours a day paintings alone in my Bali studio .  The Lockdown collection helped me cope (in a healthy & positive way) with the challenging uncertainties that were unfolding around me each day .  Every painting in this collection is a personal reflection of what I was feeling during the time span from March until December 2020 . '  "

Her mother saw talent in her and enrolled Amorós in art classes at the age of eleven . Concerned about her early success ,  Amorós moved to New York City to work as an artist .  Once there ,  she won a scholarship to study painting and printmaking at the Art Students League of New York .  She started mainly as a painter ,  but - thinking about paint in sculptural terms - eventually moved on to creating three-dimensional artworks . Grimanesa Amoro's art plays deftly with the notion that painting and sculpture might come into being through the process of shedding ,  as opposed to accumulation ,  the more physical aspects of form ,  so that the condition in which her subjects are presented does not function as a 'final' state at all ,  but more like one of several possible chosen moments within which the process of coming-into-being has been captured . Amorós' interests in three-dimensional artworks led to her exploration of paper-making processes .  She used this in her work with pieces such as La Incubadora at the Roger Smith Lab Gallery .    "

1235,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Eleanor_Antin,Eleanor_Antin,Feminist_artists,"   When she began her artistic career in New York ,  she started off as a painter and later turned to making assemblages ,  but starting in the 1960s she began to do the conceptual projects that would become her focus .  The first was Blood of a Poet Box (1965-1968) ,  in which she took blood samples from poets and put them on slides .  The work ,  which was inspired by Jean Cocteau’s film Blood of a Poet ,  eventually held 100 samples ,  including blood from Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti , In 1969 ,  she created a portrait ,  Molly Barnes ,  out of ""a lush lavender bath rug ,  a noisy electric Lady Schick razor ,  a patch of spilled talcum powder and a scattering of pink and yellow pills . ""100 Boots is Antin's best-known conceptual work .  It documents the boots in a mock picaresque photo diary ,  beginning at the Pacific Ocean and ending in New York City ,  where their journey was presented in an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art . In a famous performance work of 1972 ,  Carving :  A Traditional Sculpture ,  Antin photographed her naked body at 148 successive stages during a month of crash-dieting . In The Eight Temptations ,  1972 ,  Antin poses in mock histrionic gestures ,  resisting the temptation to eat snack foods that would violate her diet .  In the 1970s/80s ,  she created several videos in which she played invented personae ,  including an Elizabethan-style king ,  a Romantic-era ballerina ,  a contemporary black movie star called Eleanora Antinova ,  and Eleanor Nightingale ,  a character that is a combination of Florence Nightingale and the artist herself . In 1974 ,  Antin described these impersonations as part of her overarching interest in the transformational nature of the self :  ""I was interested in defining the limits of myself .  I consider the usual aids to self-definition—sex ,  age ,  talent ,  time and space—as tyrannical limitations upon my freedom of choice . ""From the 70s until the 90s Antin embodied multiple alter egos in a project that she called ""Selves"" that implemented through several art forms .  This project encompassed  four videos :  The King (1972) ,  The Ballerina and the Bum (1974) ,  The Adventures of a Nurse (1976) ,  and From the Archives of Modern Art (1987) . More recently ,  Antin completed two large scale photographic series inspired by Roman history and mythology :  The Last Days of Pompeii ,  2002 ,  and Roman Allegories ,  2005 .  Her work was profiled in Season Two of the PBS series Art : 21 . She has had dozens of solo exhibitions and has been represented in countless group exhibitions ,  including at the Hirshhorn Museum ,  the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles ,  the Kunsthalle Wien ,  and documenta 12 in Kassel . Her work is largely concerned with issues of identity and the role of women in society . In a 2009 interview ,  Antin described her path to becoming an artist :  ""When I was a kid ,  I didn't know what kind of artist I was .  I knew I was an artist ,  I just didn't know if I was an actor ,  I didn't know if I was a writer ,  I didn't even know if I was a painter .  I was fortunate that I grew up as an artist in a time when all the barriers were falling down .  It was a time of invention and discovery .  I was lucky . ""In 2013 ,  Antin published an autobiographical novel ,  Conversations with Stalin ,  about ""a young girl's struggle to find her way from her crazy dysfunctional family of first generation Jewish Stalinist immigrants"" ,  and ""her desperate ,  endearing ,  often hilarious quest for art ,  self ,  revolution and sex ,  abetted by a kindly avuncular Stalin dispensing bizarre advice .

In her installation Slumber (1994) ,  Antoni slept in the gallery for 28 days and while she slept ,  an EEG machine recorded her REM patterns ,  which she then wove into a blanket from the night gown under which she slept .  This particular work was seen as a tableau vivant because of its spectacle aspect : The aspirational focus of this tableau vivant ,  while situating the artist as an object on view ,  simulataneously Antoni explains this desire to be involved in the viewer's experience when she writes : She says of this performer/audience interaction :  ""This letter sums up my relationship to my audience .  I have a deep love for the viewer ;  they are my imaginary friend . ""Antoni has cited Louise Bourgeois as a strong artistic influence ,  referring to Bourgeois as her 'art mother . 'Antoni's work is in various public museum collections ,  including the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMoMA) ,  among others .

As a young child and in her early 20s ,  Benglis often traveled with her grandmother to Greece .  She later described these travels as having been important to her work .  In her 2015 interview with Ocula Magazine ,  the artist said that her grandmother was a significant feminist icon for her : Her husband died very early—1955 .  I was the first female grandchild—which is very important in Greece ,  as the women inherit the property .  She was my godmother ,  as well as my grandmother . My grandmother travelled in her forties ,  and this was unusual and it impacted the way I was .  It set a standard for me . Growing up ,  her father Michael ran a building-materials business . Benglis attended McNeese State University in Lake Charles ,  Louisiana .   Benglis's work is noted for an unusual blend of organic imagery and confrontation with newer media incorporating influences such as Barnett Newman and Andy Warhol . Benglis' latex and polyurethane pours of the late 1960s and 1970s marked her entry into the New York art world .  At the same time ,  she was also working on ""small encaustic relief paintingsLike other artists such as Yves Klein ,  Benglis's work resembled Jackson Pollock's flinging and dripping methods of painting .  The structure of the new medium itself played an important role in addressing questions about female identity in relation to art ,  pop culture ,  and dominant feminism movements at the time . In the 1970s ,  she turned to video as an extension of her sculptural work ,  producing over a dozen works between 1972 and 1977 .  Benglis dove into metal casting in the mid 1980s ,  most notably a series of public fountain projects . Benglis has been a professor or visiting artist at the University of Rochester (1970-1972) ,  Princeton University (1975) ,  University of Arizona (1982) ,  School of Visual Arts (1985-1987) . Benglis felt underrepresented in the male-run artistic community and so confronted the ""male ethos"" in a series of magazine advertisements satirizing pin-up girls ,  Hollywood actresses ,  and traditional depictions of nude female models in canonical works of art . In this unmaking of the tradition of the passive female nude ,  Benglis was working in dialogue with popular discourse about gender and gender performativity published at the time of its execution . Artist Barbara Wagner claims that Benglis shows that even with the appropriation of the phallus as a Freudian sign of power ,  it does not cover her female identity and still emphasizes a female inferiority . Benglis's work was greatly neglected for a long time .  However ,  in 2009 ,  a 40-year retrospective organized by the Irish Museum of Modern Art served to recognize her career .  The exhibit showed her in her true light as a main figure in contemporary art .  Not only did it show her vast amount of her work ,  it showed her enthusiasm to take on charged subjects .  The exhibition focused on the 1960s and 1970s ,  when her work was most involved with the link between painting and sculpture .  It included the lozenge-shaped wall pieces of built up multicolored wax layers that Benglis started making in 1966 with which she honored Jackson Pollock's famous drip methods .  It also included her knotted bowtie shaped wall reliefs of the 1970s and some of her videos .  Her work from the 1980s and 1990s was also shown ,  represented by a few of her famous pleats ,  which involved her spraying liquid metal onto chicken wire skeletons ,  and two videos from each of the decades . In the stateside versions of the show more works from the 1980s and 1990s were shown including her ceramics .  These pieces were made of clay and hand molded so that the viewers could feel the making of them- the extorting ,  folding ,  and throwing of the moist resistant material .  Glazes seemed to be flung on in a causal manner ,  which brings to mind the abstract expressionism movement of art in which Benglis is involved .  The ceramic pieces have a handmade quality that effect the senses both desire driven and dismal ,  while the colors suggest the glitz of commercial culture . Concentrating on Benglis's early work ,  the curators gave her a main position in the diverse art of the 70's ,  a time period that is seen as laying the groundwork for the wide range of expression that continues to grow to this day .  Benglis's willingness and ability to mix up gendered tropes with her heroic scales and sparkly colorful finishes while laughing irreverently at views of every moral stripe set her apart from the common customs of feminism and the sexism of the art world .  Her work is also deemed important for its meticulous grounding in process and materials used .  Each piece produces its own physical understanding .  ""They provoke visceral reactions while playfully welcoming open ended associations and ambiguities . ""In 2011 ,  The New Museum organized a four-decade exhibition of Benglis's sculptural works with supplementary videos ,  Polaroids ,  and magazine clippings .  The show received high praise in the New Yorker magazine ,  which warned viewers to ""prepare to be floored . ""This subsequent survey focused on the exploratory breadth of materials Benglis experimented with over the course of her career :  polyurethane foam ,  glass ,  enamel ,  stainless steel ,  beeswax ,  and poured latex .  It was her first major survey in the UK . Lynda Benglis :  Water Sources was the first exhibition centered around the outdoor water fountains that Benglis has developed since the early 1980s .  More broadly ,  this presentation took as its point of departure the interest in water and landscape that Benglis has explored throughout the last thirty years of her career . In this new work presented at Cheim & Read Gallery in New York ,  Benglis turned to handmade paper ,  which she wrapped around thick wire armatures ,  often painting the sand-tone surface in bright ,  metallic colors offset by strokes of deep ,  coal-based black .  At other times the paper was left virtually bare .  As Nancy Princenthal writes in her essay published in the accompanying exhibition catalogue ,  these works reflect the environment in which they were made ,  the 'sere and windblown' landscape of Santa Fe ,  New Mexico .  As a counterweight to the paper sculptures ,  Benglis also exhibited ""The Fall Caught"" ,  a large-scale aluminum work made by applying spray foam instead of strips of handmade paper on the chicken wire armature ,  as well as a new series of spiraling ,  hand-built black ceramics called ""Elephant Necklace"" . In December 2016 ,  Lynda Benglis had her very first solo show in Italy ,  titled ""Benglis and the Baroque"" ,  at Thomas Brambilla gallery .  The exhibition included a series of large scale marble Torsos specially made for the show .  ""Benglis and the Baroque"" explored Benglis' long-held interest in Baroque sculpture ;  much like Gianlorenzo Bernini ,  Benglis seeks to freeze the intensity of the moment and merge beauty and sensuality in spectacular frozen gestures .  Benglis' attention to materials and ongoing research into the ""extravagant"" are in full agreement with Baroque poetics . Throughout 2016 ,  the Bergen Assembly in Bergen ,  Norway presented a cycle of events ,  publications ,  and exhibitions on the artistic practice of Lynda Benglis .  Curated by Rhea Dall and Kristine Siegel ,  PRAXES Center for Contemporary Art . The Government of Puebla presented the work of Lynda Benglis as the second temporary exhibition ,  ""Cuerpos ,  Materia y Alma :  Las Esculturas de Lynda Benglis"" ,  at the International Museum of the Baroque .  The exuberant forms ,  folds and contortions ,  variety of materials ,  textures and colors ,  in addition to the size of sculptures ,  expressed a new sensibility in neobaroque art :  contemporary ,  daring and dynamic .  Benglis's purpose was to engage in a dialogue with the architecture of Toyo Ito ,  the Museum's designer ,  and to express her fondness for Mexico . NEON Organization for Culture and Development organized Lynda Benglis's first solo museum exhibition in a country that has played a major role in her life and vision :  Greece .  The exhibition Lynda Benglis :  In the Realm of the Senses  unites 36 of the artist’s singular creations ,  spanning half a century from 1969 onwards . Benglis created a series of prints as part of a collaboration with master printer Stan Baden with the Print Research Institute of North Texas at the University of North Texas . During the 1970s ,  Benglis engaged in dialogues relating to the feminist movement through her art by pioneering a radical body of video work made up of fifteen videos .  She turned to video art in 1971 in order to explore a media that could more easily communicate her feminist politics . Benglis's interest in human form found in her sculptural work is made present in her videos in through the consistent theme of self-reflexivity .  Video offers a direct representation of a figure ,  a history of popular culture ,  and a way to illustrate bodies interacting in space ,  making it useful for feminist discourse .  Benglis employs various technical manipulations of video as a medium to complicate the boundaries of visual form and highlight mediations of the self ,  including a recursive technique by filming television screens playing videos that she had filmed previously ,  often several layers deep .  By doing so ,  she further exposes the interface between inner and outer realities by using and reproducing her own body and its image through video manipulations ,  interacting with her own image and voice ,  and confusing the viewer's perception of time and space .  Consequently ,  Benglis's work destabilizes what are traditionally believed to be video's ""inherent properties"" such as liveness and ""real"" time ,  spatial orientation and relations ,  and separation of creator and creation . In 1971 ,  Benglis began to collaborate with Robert Morris ,  and produced her first video work ,  Mumble (1972) .  Morris's Exchange (1973) also came out of this collaboration .  Mumble features figures arranged in space across several screens .  Often ,  the artist will announce the relation from them to the person from off camera ,  sometimes calling them multiple different names and labeling them with different ,  incompatible roles .  The viewer becomes distrustful of the narrator ,  calling into question the role and authority of any voiceover speech .  Other statements in this video are descriptions such as ""Robin is weaving in the studio downstairs , "" and ""the phone is ringing . "" The straightforward nature of these statements stands in contrast to the confusion created by the recursive screens .  The viewer has no way of knowing if the phone is ringing while the artist is filming the final video ,  or when she was filming Morriss in the very bottom layer ,  or the layer in between .  The warped sense of time and space works to question the privilege of visuality in such a strongly visual culture ,  offering a critique of television as a medium as well as the potential truthfulness of any image . Benglis completed four other videos in 1972 ,  namely Noise ,  Document ,  Home Tapes Revised ,  and On Screen .  All feature her recursive screen technique .  Document and On Screen feature particularly strong feminist themes ,  and both feature the artist directly .  Document features a progression undergone by the artist from directed to director ,  finishing with her writing copyright information juxtaposed to her own image .  In this way ,  she reclaims and maintains control of her image ,  a feminist act for a female artist .  Similarly ,  On Screen shows the artist making faces at the camera in recursive layers of video .  She performs expressions reminiscent of ones that people make in a mirror when no one is looking ,  and then magnifies it threefold through repetition .  In this way ,  she blocks the potential interpretation of her image and emotional state being present for others . One of her own more noted videos is Female Sensibility (1973) ,  which shows the artist kissing and licking the face of fellow artist Marilyn Lenkowsky . In  Noise (1972) Benglis employs mechanical reproduction and through looped feedback tapes .  Throughout Noise ,  she plays over several generations of similar taped images and soundtracks to introduce increasing amounts of distortion .  The conversion of the looped and layered aural and visual components highlights the boundaries of intelligibility ,  resulting in the disassociation of sound and image . Lynda Benglis' works distributed by the Video Data Bank include :   "

1256,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Judith_Bernstein,Judith_Bernstein,Feminist_artists,"   Throughout Bernstein’s work there is playfulness within the repetition of a motif . Bernstein’s most well-known artworks are her subsequent series of biomorphic screw drawings ,  which she began in 1969 .  These monumental pieces provocatively appropriate the image of the screw as a phallic symbol of oppression—as in the expression “being screwed”—and evoke ominous power .  One of these works ,  Horizontal (1973) ,  was censored from the exhibition “Focus :  Women’s Work— American Art in 1974” at the Museum of the Philadelphia Civic Center for “lacking redeeming social value , ” phraseology commonly applied to pornography .  At the time ,  a petition letter was issued in protest ,  signed by many significant artists ,  critics ,  and curators ,  including Clement Greenberg ,  Linda Nochlin ,  Lucy Lippard ,  Louise Bourgeois ,  and the New Museum’s Founding Director ,  Marcia Tucker . Bernstein is an active feminist and founding member of the women’s cooperative A . I . R .  Gallery in New York . Because of pervasive sexism in the art industry ,  it was difficult to land exhibition engagements ,  and Bernstein had a hard time gaining recognition for her artwork until the 21st Century . In 2016 ,  Bernstein had two solo shows ;  Dicks of Death at Mary Boone Gallery in New York City and Rising at the Kunsthall Stavanger in Norway ,  along with the launch of her artist catalogue ,  Judith Bernstein Rising (Mousse Publishing) . She lives and works in New York City .   "

It premiered at the International Film Festival Rotterdam , Biller's second feature film ,  The Love Witch ,  premiered in 2016 at the International Film Festival Rotterdam .  The film is a twist on classic serial killer films ,  featuring a woman who kills through calculated sexuality and ""love magic"" ,  causing her male victims to fall too much in love .  In a series of tweets ,  Biller revealed that most of the film’s crew “hated what we were shooting and did not even see the movie after it was done . ” When asked why this occurred ,  Biller replied ,  “I think it has something to do with being a female director ,  and something to do with how the line producer set up a bad vibe and then disappeared . ” Richard Brody of The New Yorker said of The Love Witch ,  ""Biller puts genre to the test of do-it-yourself artistry ,  and puts feminist ideology itself to the test of style .  The film pulsates with furious creative energy throughout ,  sparking excitement and giddy amazement that it even exists . ""In 2019 ,  she became a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences . Biller has said that her next film will be a Bluebeard story . On December 05 ,  2021 ,  Biller announced she has completed her first novel .    "

She is currently based in New York City ,  though she has previously been based in Berlin and London .   After receiving a Masters of Fine Arts in art writing from Goldsmiths College ,  University of London . In March 2017 ,  Black posted an open letter on her Facebook page to the curators of the Whitney Biennial in response to the painting Open Casket by American artist Dana Schutz .  Black's letter advocated the removal of the painting with the additional ""urgent recommendation"" that it be destroyed .  Black's letter became the focus of an ensuing debate around race ,  representation and notions of free speech that ""split the art world"" .  The controversy received international attention in both mainstream and art media . In 2019 ,  Black ,  Ciarán Finlayson ,  and Tobi Haslett released a statement in Artforum titled The Tear Gas Biennial ,  decrying the involvement of Warren Kanders ,  co-chair of the board of the Whitney Museum ,  and his ""toxic philanthropy . "" As of 1925 ,  the Geneva Convention has outlawed the use of tear gas in all international military conflict ,  however ,  the tear gas fired at peaceful protesters and civilians by the police and military during the George Floyd protests as well as migrants on the US-Mexico border is the same brand of tear gas manufactured by Defense Technology ,  a subsidy of Safariland .  A wave of artists from the Biennial ,  including Korakrit Arunanondchai ,  Meriem Bennani ,  Nicole Eisenman and Nicholas Galanin ,  demanded immediate removal of their work from the Biennial within hours after the essay was published .  After mounting pressure from additional artists ,  critics ,  and patrons urging the public to boycott the show ,  Kanders stepped down from his leadership position at the museum .  The essay was instrumental in Kanders resignation as well as the museum cutting ties with Kanders financial endowments that are directly connected to the promotion and use of military weaponry and violence during peaceful social unrest .

She graduated in Photography and Decoration from the Madrid School of Plastic Arts .

An early exhibition in which she participated was in 1983 at the Africa Centre ,  London ,  entitled Five Black Women .  Boyce's early works were large chalk-and-pastel drawings depicting friends ,  family and childhood experiences .  Drawing from her background she often included depictions of wallpaper patterns and bright colours associated with the Caribbean .  Through this work the artist examined her position as a black woman in Britain and the historical events in which that experience was rooted . In 1989 ,  she was a part of a group of four female artists who created an exhibition called ""The Other Story , "" which was the first display of British African ,  Caribbean ,  and Asian Modernism . In her later works Boyce used diverse media including digital photography to produce composite images depicting contemporary black life .  Although her focus is seen to have shifted away from specific ethnic experiences ,  her themes continue to be the experiences of a black woman living in a white society ,  and how religion ,  politics and sexual politics made up that experience . Boyce was awarded an MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours List 2007 ,  for services to art . In 2016 ,  Boyce became a Royal Academician ,  a society in England created by George III for artists and designers . In 2018 ,  as part of a retrospective exhibition by Boyce at Manchester Art Gallery ,  she was invited by the curators of the gallery to make new work in dialogue with the collection's 18th- and 19th-century galleries ,  for which Boyce invited performance artists to engage with these works in these galleries in ,  as the artists has said ,  'a non-binary way' .  As part of one of these events the artists decided to temporarily remove J .  W .  Waterhouse's painting Hylas and the Nymphs from the gallery wall ,  prompting a wide discussion of issues of censorship and curatorial decision-making ,  interpretation and judgement ,  by gallery audiences and in the media . Boyce has taught widely and uses workshops as part of her creative process ,  and her works can be seen in many national collections . In 2018 she was the subject of the BBC Four documentary film Whoever Heard of a Black Artist? Britain's Hidden Art History ,  in which Brenda Emmanus followed Boyce as she traveled the UK following the history of black artists and modernism .  Boyce led a team in preparing an exhibition at Manchester Art Gallery that focused on artists of African and Asian descent who have played a part in shaping the history of British art . She was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2019 New Year Honours for services to art . It was announced in February 2020 that Boyce had been selected as the first black woman to represent the United Kingdom at the 2021 59th annual Venice Biennale .  She was chosen by the British Council and will produce a major solo exhibition .

As a child she became fascinated by a wood carving of a bird that her father made .  In high school ,  she studied art with a descendant of Frederick Douglass .   Very early in her career ,  Catlett accepted a Public Works of Art Project assignment with the federal government for unemployed artists during the 1930s .  However ,  she was fired for lack of initiative ,  very likely due to immaturity .  The experience gave her exposure to the socially-themed work of Diego Rivera and Miguel Covarrubias .

After receiving her undergraduate degree ,  her first teaching position was in the Durham ,  North Carolina school system .  She taught art at Hillside High School .

During this period ,  Citron often drew her subject matter from her urban surroundings ,  depicting the people and places of Union Station in an urban realist style .  Her work was also influenced by that of artist Honoré Daumier .  In 1935 ,  Citron had her first major critically acclaimed solo show titled ""Feminanities , "" at the Midtown Gallery in New York City .  Pieces such as Beauty Parlor (1933) and Demonstration (1932) depicted women's preoccupation with the culture of beauty ,  while pieces such as Cold Comfort (1935) more directly address the objectification of women for the pleasure of men . In the late 1930s ,  Citron became involved with the Works Progress Administration Federal Art Project ,  working as a teacher from 1935 to 1937 ,  and completing numerous government mural commissions between 1938 and 1942 .

Soon after World War II she traveled abroad to Paris .  In the 1950s ,  she taught art at the High School of Music & Art where she was respected as a teacher who introduced her students to all the possible means of expression from realism to the current avant-garde abstract expressionists . A 1960 solo exhibit in Zagreb was the first time an American artist had mounted such a show in Yugoslavia .  In the 1970s (when she was in her seventies) ,  she strongly identified with the women's movement and considered herself a feminist at heart ,  although she was never directly involved with organized feminist movements or protests .

1310,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Renee_Cox,Renee_Cox,Feminist_artists,"   As a student at Syracuse University ,  Cox majored in film studies .  After graduating ,  she decided to devote her energy to the realm of still photography .  She began as an assistant fashion editor at Glamour Magazine and then moved to Paris to pursue a career as a fashion photographer .  She spent three years working in Paris ,  shooting for magazines including Votre Beaute and Vogue Homme and for designers Issey Miyake and Claude Montana ,  among others . Cox then returned to New York City ,  where she continued to work as a fashion photographer for ten years .  Among her clients were editorial magazines such as Essence ,  Cosmopolitan ,  Mademoiselle ,  and Seventeen .  She also worked with Spike Lee ,  producing the poster for his 1988 film School Daze . In the early 1990s ,  inspired by the birth of her first son ,  Cox decided to focus primarily on fine art photography .  She received her Master of Fine Arts at the School of Visual Arts in New York and subsequently spent a year working with Mary Kelly and Ron Clark in the Whitney Independent Study Program . In 1994 ,  Cox exhibited her piece It Shall Be Named described the work as referring ""back to traditional art forms—in this case ,  the shaped crucifixes of 13th and 14th century Italy—with deep solemnity .  The modern ""distortions"" and elisions of Cox's representation interact with the reference to iconic martyrdom to evoke the terrible history of lynchings ,  beatings and emasculation visited on the bodies of black men in this country . ""That same year ,  Cox's seven-foot nude self-portrait Yo Mama was included in the Bad Girls show curated by Marcia Tucker at the New Museum .  Cox was the first woman ever to be pregnant during the Whitney Independent Study Program , In 1995 ,  Cox ,  Fo Wilson and Tony Cokes created the Negro Art Collective (NAC) to fight cultural misrepresentations about Black Americans .  The collective ,  working with Creative Time and Gee Street Records ,  created a poster campaign to challenge and provoke preconceived notions about race ,  crime and poverty .  ""As far as representation ,  we have to take it back , "" Cox explained to the Daily News .  The NAC appropriated a quote from scholar Charles Murray and added their commentary so as to appropriate the quote for their purposes .  The idea was to present viewers with real information ,  which flies in the face of what Americans are taught to believe .  The 24 by 36inch posters read :  ""Surprise ,  Surprise ,  'in raw numbers ,  European-American whites are the ethnic group with the most people in poverty ,  most illegitimate children ,  most people on welfare ,  most unemployed men ,  and most arrests for serious crimes . ' Surprised . ""  The posters ran in Manhattan ,  Brooklyn and Los Angeles .  The project was originally inspired by Cox's five-year-old son who had asked her one day :  ""Why are all black people bad?""Soon after ,  Cox created her Raje alter-ego ,  a superhero who fights racism and teaches children African-American history .  In 1998 the body of work was featured in a Fin de Siècle art festival in Nantes ,  France .  Nantes was historically the last stop on the slave trade ,  before the ships were to return to Africa to pick up their human cargo .  The photographs were installed on billboards all over the city . In 1999 ,  Cox's work was shown in the Venice Biennale ,  in the Oratorio di S .  Ludovico ,  a 17th-century Catholic church ,  where her piece Yo Mama's Last Supper a contemporary re-imagining of Leonardo da Vinci's classic ,  was first shown .  In Cox's reimagining of this historically iconic scene ,  she stood nude in the place of Jesus Christ and is surrounded by all black apostles ,  except for Judas ,  who is white .  In 2001 ,  the piece was included in a Brooklyn Museum of Art exhibition Committed to the Image :  Contemporary Black Photographers ,  curated by Barbara Millstein . In 2001 ,  Cox opened a show at the Robert Miller Gallery called American Family .  The series featured family snapshots ,  as well as older family photographs juxtaposed with erotic self-portraits ,  and new re-creations of art historical classics .  ""Olympia's Boyz"" is featured in this show ,  which first appeared at the Brooklyn Museum in 2001 .  Cox has written :  ""The body of work was a rebellion against all of the pre-ordained roles I am supposed to embrace as a woman :  dutiful daughter ,  diminutive wife ,  and doting mother . ""Later that year Cox undertook another series of photographs ,  this one named for the Jamaican national heroine ,  Queen Nanny of the Maroons .  In the series ,  Cox took on the persona of Queen Nanny ,  who led the Maroons to victory in the First Maroon War .  Queen Nanny of the Maroons was originally shown at the Robert Miller Gallery in 2005 .  Cox then exhibited the body of work in the Jamaican Biennial in 2007 where it won the Aaron Matalon Award . Cox continues to show her work as well as develop new projects as she is inspired .  Her present work explores sacred geometry and the use of fractals to create sculptural kaleidoscopes .  Soul CultureWriting for Vogue magazine ,  art critic Roberta Smith described Yo Mama as ""one of the most striking images in the East Coast portion of the Bad Girls exhibition…A towering self-portrait ,  it showed the artist ,  naked except for a pair of black high heels ,  holding her two-year-old son…The image presents a woman ,  both regal and erotic ,  who seems singularly disinclined to take guff from anyone and whose son will undoubtedly grow up to respect her gender . ""In 2001 ,  Yo Mama's Last Supper sparked an enormous controversy when Rudy Giuliani ,  then mayor of New York City ,  saw the work and proceeded to accuse Cox of being anti-Catholic .  Giuliani gained national attention when he subsequently called for the creation of a panel to create decency standards for all art shown in publicly funded museums in the city .  Giuliani told the Daily News that he did ""not believe that it is right for public money to be used to desecrate religion ,  to attack people's ethnicity . ""Cox's Yo Mama is one of the focuses of writer Sheila F .  Winborne's chapter ,  ""Images of Jesus in Advancing Great Commission"" ,  in the book Teaching All Nations :  Interrogating the Matthean Great Commission . Cox publicly responded to Giuliani's accusations by defending her first amendment right to portray herself as Christ .  As Cox explained ,  her Catholic school education taught her that all human beings were created in the likeness of God .  ""It's all very hypocritical , "" she was quoted as saying in the Daily News ,  ""now that he has been busted with the other woman ,  I wouldn't be talking about moral issues . "" At the time ,  Giuliani had recently admitted his affair with long-time friend Judy Nathan and proceeded to divorce his wife ,  Donna Hanover . Cox states that her reasoning for her Yo Mama's Last Supper piece was because ""Christianity is big in the African-American community ,  but there are no presentations of us , "" Cox added ,  ""I took it upon myself to include people of color in these classic scenarios . ""This was the second time during Giuliani's tenure that he attempted to censor art shown in New York City's museums and it sparked a national controversy about artists' first amendment rights .   "

1353,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Valie_Export,Valie_Export,Feminist_artists," Valie Export was born Waltraud Lehner in Linz ,  Austria and was raised in Linz by a single mother of three .   In the late 1960s and early 1970s ,  Austrian feminism was forced to address the fact that by the 1970s there was still a generation of Austrians whose attitudes towards women were based on Nazi ideology .  They also had to confront the guilt of their parents’ (mothers’) complacency within the Nazi regime .  In 1967 ,  she changed her name from Waltraud Hollinger to VALIE EXPORT .  In conversation with Gary Indiana for BOMB magazine ,  Export described her name-change : ""I did not want to have the name of my father  With this gesture of self-determination ,  Export emphatically asserted her identity within the Viennese art scene ,  which was then dominated by the taboo-breaking performance art of the Vienna Actionists such as Hermann Nitsch ,  Günter Brus ,  Otto Mühl ,  and Rudolf Schwarzkogler .  Of the Actionist movement ,  Export has said ,  “I was very influenced ,  not so much by Actionism itself ,  but by the whole movement in the city .  It was a really great movement .  We had big scandals ,  sometimes against the politique ;  it helped me to bring out my ideas . ”Export's early guerrilla performances have attained an iconic status in feminist art history .  In her 1968 performance Aktionshose : Genitalpanik (Action Pants :  Genital Panic) ,  Export entered an art cinema in Munich ,  wearing crotchless pants ,  and walked around the audience with her exposed genitalia at face level .  The associated photographs were taken in 1969 in Vienna ,  by photographer Peter Hassmann .  The performance at the art cinema and the photographs in 1969 were both aimed toward provoking thought about the passive role of women in cinema and confrontation of the private nature of sexuality with the public venues of her performances . Export's well-known performance piece Tapp-und-Tast-Kino (Tap and Touch Cinema) was performed in ten European cities ,  including Vienna and Munich ,  from 1968-1971 . In Tap and Touch Cinema ,  Export inverts the sight-dependent functions of film and substitutes the ""pleasure"" of vision for physical touch . Some of her other works including Invisible Adversaries ,  ""Syntagma , "" and ""Korpersplitter , "" show the artist's body in connection to historical buildings not only physically ,  but also symbolically .  The body’s attachment to the historical progression of gendered spaces and stereotyped roles represent Export's feminist and political approach to art . In her 1970 photograph ,  “Body Sign Action , ” Export portrays a politically charged agenda through her performance artwork .  The piece features a tattoo of a garter belt on Export's naked upper leg .  The garter is not attached at the top and only attached to a sliver of a stocking at the bottom- therefore suspended on the leg .  Instead of the garter objectifying the body ,  the body objectifies the garter ,  flipping constructed societal roles in relation to the female body . Export's groundbreaking video piece ,  Facing a Family (1971) was one of the first instances of television intervention and broadcasting video art .  The video ,  originally broadcast on the Austrian television program Kontakte February 2 ,  1971 ,  shows a bourgeois Austrian family watching TV while eating dinner .  When other middle-class families watched this program on TV ,  the television would be holding a mirror up to their experience and complicating the relationship between subject ,  spectator ,  and television . Export published “Women’s Art :  A Manifesto” in 1972 .  In it ,  she advocated for women to “speak so that they can find themselves ,  this is what I ask for in order to achieve a self-defined image of ourselves and thus a different view of the social function of women . ” This statement directly related her own work to the progress of empowering women . Export's 1973 short film ,  ""Remote ,  Remote , "" exemplifies the painful ramifications of the female body conforming to societal standards .  In this piece she digs at her cuticles with a knife for twelve minutes ,  representing the damage societal beauty standards inflict on the female body . Based on the precepts laid out in her 1972 manifesto ,  Export curated an exhibition of feminist art at the Galerie nachst St .  Stepan in Vienna in 1975 .  Titled MAGNA .  Feminism :  Art and Creativity ,  this exhibition “introduced the feminist artist as curator and as contemporary art historian . ”1977 saw the release of her first feature film ,  Unsichtbare Gegner .  For this film's script ,  she collaborated with her former partner ,  Peter Weibel . In her 1983 experimental film ,  Syntagma ,  Export attempted to reframe the female body by using a multitude of "" .  .  . different cinematic montage techniques—doubling the body through overlays ,  for example"" . Her 1985 film The Practice of Love was entered into the 35th Berlin International Film Festival . Since 1995/1996 Export has held a professorship for multimedia performance at the Academy of Media Arts Cologne . In 2016 ,  the city of Linz acquired her archive and opened a research center devoted to her work . Bard College hosted an exhibition centered around Export’s 1977 film Unsichtbare Gegner in 2016 .  The show featured work by Export as well as artists for whom Export’s art “blew open doors :  Lorna Simpson ,  K8 Hardy ,  Hito Steyerl ,  Trisha Donnelly and Emily Jacir ,  among others . ”In 2019 ,  Export won the Roswitha Haftmann Prize of £120 , 000 ,  which is “Europe’s largest single-award art prize . ”  "

The ironic kitsch themes in her early work influenced Jeff Koons .

It is also called super-realism ,  radical realism ,  or hyper-realism and painters like Richard Estes ,  Denis Peterson ,  Audrey Flack ,  and Chuck Close often worked from photographic stills to create paintings that appeared to be photographs . ""Art critic Robert C .  Morgan writes in The Brooklyn Rail about Flack's 2010 exhibition at Gary Snyder Project Space ,  Audrey Flack Paints a Picture ,  ""She has taken the signs of indulgence ,  beauty ,  and excess and transformed them into deeply moving symbols of desire ,  futility ,  and emancipation . ""Flack has claimed to have found the photorealist movement too restricting ,  and now gains much of her inspiration from Baroque art . Flack is currently represented by the Louis K .  Meisel Gallery and Hollis Taggart Galleries .

1401,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Roxana_Halls,Roxana_Halls,Feminist_artists," Halls was born in Plaistow ,  London . Growing up ,  she aspired to be an actress and her long-standing interest in drama and performance is evident in the baroque sensibility of many of her works .  Halls has said that she often equates painting with performance and that her models collude with her in creating theatrical scenarios for which the viewer is invited to tease out narratives .  Describing herself as mainly self-taught ,  Halls took a foundation course in art at Plymouth College of Art and Design but found that she was very self-reliant .  When she moved to London ,  she ‘just painted ,  worked hard ,  went to the National Gallery constantly and did it that way . ’ She moved near a former theatre in south London where she established her first studio .   Halls’s practice has relied on painting from life ,  memory ,  and photographs .  Referencing everything from high art and philosophy to the zeitgeist (including ,  at different times ,  Charcot’s ‘The Iconographie Photographique de la Salpêtrière , ’ Hélène Cixous’s écriture feminine ,  the war time paintings of Dame Laura Knight ,  Bosch’s The Garden of Earthly Delights ,  the songs of Nick Cave ,  Peaches and Robert Wyatt ,  Sylvia Plath ,  avantgarde cinema ,  and the fashion for glamorising the past) ,  Halls’s paintings examine gender ,  class ,  identity and sexuality .  .  A voracious researcher ,  Halls has claimed she is magpie-like ,  attracted by beautiful things but also by the discarded and careworn .  She collects costumes - often foraged from charity or thrift shops - from different countries and periods ,  aware that the stories of their owners may remain forever unknowable . Her paintings focus on the materiality of people’s lived environments ,  seducing the viewer with exquisite still lifes or her emphasis on fabrics and hair .  Often domestic in scale and subject ,  they rebut the notion that grandiose history paintings are a better barometer of contemporary life .  They ask :  how is women’s behaviour policed by society and how do women internalise those expectations and limitations through self-surveillance?Whilst her ‘Shadow Play’ and ‘Suspended Women’ series (2012) may recall the surrealism of artists like Dorothea Tanning or Meret Oppenheim ,  Halls does not consider her work surreal .  However ,  performance ,  theatricality ,  illusion ,  and magic are recurring themes .  Her exhibition ‘Roxana Halls’ Tingle-Tangle , ’ produced for the National Theatre ,  London in 2009 borrowed the language of cabaret performance ,  Halls re-imaging herself as the impresario of a troupe .  For her painting Terina The Paper Tearer and Inferna The Human Torch ,  she performed Inferna ,  a character she created after being inspired by a costume she found in a charity shop in Brixton .  Whilst she used external performers for other works in the series ,  self-portraits have always been an important aspect of her oeuvre though Halls has stated that she rarely paints herself as herself .  Halls allows paintings to evolve in the making rather than beginning with preparatory drawings .  This mirrors her interest in depicting women in evolving states ,  in liminal states ,  held sometimes in suspension . Halls has also explored consumption and abstinence ,  as in her 'Appetite' series (2013-14) ,  where women transgress by not behaving as they are expected to :  Halls shows one gorging on popcorn ,  eating with her mouth open (referencing ,  perhaps ,  the eighteenth century celebrity portraitist Elisabeth Vigée-LeBrun and her innovation of showing her teeth in her self-portraits – something that was considered uncouth or deemed the sign of a maniac ;  Halls paints the teeth last in her paintings) .  Inspired by Artemisia Gentileschi and Caravaggio’s versions of Judith and Holofernes ,  another woman (Halls again) takes over the traditionally male role in Carvery ,  2013 where platters of working-class food teeter on the edge of this feast for one ,  much like the plate in Caravaggio’s Supper at Emmaus .  She wields her implements ,  carving out her own place in the world . One of Halls’s most renowned series - 'Laughing While' (2012 onwards) – depicts women engaged in more transgressive acts that interrogate encultured norms around femininity .  These women are always active subjects — often breaking propriety just by eating messily (Laughing While Eating Yoghurt ,  2017) or laughing out loud .  Halls cites Cixous’s retelling of the Chinese general Sun Tse ‘who decapitates a group of women he is trying to train as soldiers ,  so disconcerted ,  so disgusted is he by their persistent laughter and refusal to take his orders seriously .  This resonates with me deeply .  Acts of political resistance come in many forms and when I paint images of women laughing ,  eating ,  reclining ,  reading or simply looking ,  I am always cognisant of the fact that the most seemingly innocuous actions can be subversive . ’ In many of the images ,  the women’s ‘bad’ behaviour becomes less innocuous and tips towards making them a danger to others and possibly to themselves .  They jilt ,  commit arson ,  vandalise ,  loot ,  maraud . In 2020 Halls was invited to paint Portrait of Katie Tomkins ,  Mortuary & Post Mortem Services Manager by her colleague Natalie Miles-Kemp on behalf of West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust for what became a major lockdown art project in the UK during the global Covid pandemic :  Portraits for NHS Heroes .  conceived by Tom Croft . Halls was also commissioned to make portraits for Katherine Parkinson’s play Sitting (filmed by BBC Arts & Avalon Productions for BBC Four as part of the Lights Up festival ,  April 2021) .  She and Parkinson were recorded in conversation at her London studio for BBC Radio 4's Only Artists .  Inspired by Artemisia Gentileschi’s Self-portrait as St .  Catherine ,  Halls’s exhibition 'Crime Spree' (2021) examines the taboo subject of women and criminality . Halls’s work is in myriad private and public collections ,  both in the U . K .  and overseas .  Besides solo exhibitions at Beaux Arts ,  Bath ;  Hay Hill ,  London ;  and at Reuben Colley Fine Art ,  Birmingham ,  her work has been shown in numerous group shows in the UK and US ,  including the BP Portrait Award at The National Portrait Gallery ,  London ,  The R . A .  Summer Exhibition ,  The Royal Society of Portrait Painters ,  The Discerning Eye ,  The Ruth Borchard Self Portrait Competition .  In 2004 ,  Halls won the Villiers David Prize which enabled her to visit Berlin for the first time and make her 'Cabaret' series .  In 2010 ,  she won the Founder’s Purchase Prize at the ING Discerning Eye show and thus entered their collection .  Her 2019 portrait of Scottish musician Horse McDonald was acquired for the permanent collection of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery .  The portrait’s pose derived from an amalgam of all the live moments ,  mannerisms and movements ,  Halls witnessed in her studio while Horse performed her best-loved song “Careful , ” for her live and a cappella ;  the pose was the one Halls felt best encapsulated her sitter . In 2020 Halls became a founder-member of InFems Art Collective .   "
1402,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Barbara_Hammer,Barbara_Hammer,Feminist_artists,"   Hammer’s career worked within experimental 16mm film and video spanned 5 decades and her body of work includes almost 100 films . Hammer’s mid-career films danced between short film and feature length .  This part of her career was staged by her decision to move from California to New York ,  a decision provoked in part by her desire to remove herself from the environment that directed her towards the cultural feminism of her early films that faced such harsh critique . Hammer’s late career coincides with her rise to public prominence with museum retrospectives and her acquisition of a Guggenheim Fellowship .  This section of her body of work focused on the body as it aged ,  hurt ,  and moved .   "

1407,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Mary_Harron,Mary_Harron,Feminist_artists," Born in Bracebridge ,  Ontario ,  Canada ,  Harron's first stepmother ,  Virginia Leith ,  was discovered by Stanley Kubrick and acted in his first film ,  Fear and Desire and was also featured in the 1962 cult classic The Brain That Wouldn't Die .  Leith's brief acting career partly inspired Harron's interest in making The Notorious Bettie Page .  Harron's stepfather is the novelist Stephen Vizinczey best known for his internationally successful book In Praise of Older Women .  Harron's second stepmother is the Canadian singer Catherine McKinnon .  Harron's sister ,  Kelley Harron ,  is an actor and producer . Harron moved to England when she was thirteen and later attended St Anne's College ,  Oxford University ,  where she received a Bachelors in English .  She then moved to New York City and was part of its 1970s punk scene .   In New York ,  Harron helped start and write for Punk magazine as a music journalist ;  she was the first journalist to interview the Sex Pistols for an American publication .  She grew up in the early punk scene of America .  She found the culture easy for her to fit into and was constantly evolving and spreading into new demographics . During the 1990s ,  Harron moved back to New York where she worked as a producer for PBS's Edge ,  a program dedicated to exploring American pop culture .  It was at this time that Harron became interested in the life of Valerie Solanas ,  the woman who attempted to kill Andy Warhol .  Harron suggested making a documentary about Solanas to her producers ,  who in turn encouraged her to develop the project into what would be her first feature film . Harron's feature film directorial debut ,  I Shot Andy Warhol ,  released in 1996 ,  is the partially imagined story of Valerie Solanas' failed assassination attempt on Andy Warhol .  She explains her interest in Solanas' life : For Solanas ,  there was this fierce ,  outsider quality to her unhappiness and frustration .  That was a time in my life when I was frustrated myself in my work .  I wanted to direct .  I had the idea years before I got to direct myself .  So I think there were elements of my own frustration and elements of what it was like growing up with an unfair attitude towards women .  .  .  and Valerie was an extreme example of that .  There was also the intellectual interest of how someone can be so brilliant and her life goes so wrong ,  and also ,  that she was so forgotten and misunderstood .  In both cases ,  I felt like Valerie had been consigned to history as this lunatic ,  almost nothing written about her . It won the sole acting award at that year's Sundance Film Festival for Lili Taylor's performance as Solanas . Harron's second film ,  American Psycho ,  released in 2000 ,  is based on the book of the same title by Bret Easton Ellis ,  which is notorious for its graphic descriptions of torture and murder .  The protagonist ,  Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) ,  is an investment banker who goes on a killing spree .  The New York Times' Stephen Holden wrote of the film : From the opening credits ,  in which drops of blood are confused with red berry sauce drizzled on an exquisitely arranged plate of nouvelle cuisine ,  the movie establishes its insidious balance of humor and aestheticized gore . The film was mired in controversy before production began ,  due in large part to the legacy of the book's release . Although some criticized American Psycho for its violence against women ,  Harron and Turner made conscious decisions that project the female influence on this adaption .  Harron's adaptation of this film changes the focus from purely Bateman's perspective to showcase the faces of the women as ""the perspective in those murder scenes wasn't through Patrick Bateman but the women . ""In the years following its release ,  the film has achieved cult status ;  the controversy surrounding it ,  to some ,  gave way to an appreciation of the film's satirical qualities ,  while many others remain critical of its violence and depiction of 1980s decadence . The Notorious Bettie Page ,  released in 2005 ,  starred Gretchen Mol as Bettie Page ,  the 1950s pinup model who became a sexual icon .  The film shows Page as the daughter of religious and conservative parents ,  as well as the fetish symbol who became a target of a Senate investigation of pornography .  For this film ,  Harron did historical character research ,  and interviewed several of Page's friends as well as Page's first husband .  Page was legally bound to another project and so unable to be interviewed .  Harron saw Page as an unwitting feminist figure who represented a movement for women's sexual liberation ,  with some similarities to and differences from Solanas .  About the film ,  Harron said in 2006 : Clearly Bettie is a very inspiring figure to young women because she had a strong independent streak .  She did what she wanted to do and she wasn't just doing it for men  .  .  .  But I think it's a huge mistake to think of her as a conscious feminist heroine .  As far as I can see ,  she didn't have an agenda ,  ever .  She just followed her own path unconsciously .  I don't think she thought of herself as a rebel in any way .  She was kind of in her own world of dress-up . Harron later stated that the film suffered from false expectations ,  in that many male critics and male viewers expected and wanted the film to be ""sexy"" ,  but that the film instead portrayed ""what it’s like to be Bettie"" ,  and Page herself did not get a ""sexual charge"" out of her modelling . The Moth Diaries (2011) ,  Harron's fourth feature film ,  is another adaption of an American novel ,  being based on Rachel Klein's 2002 novel of the same name .  The film follows a group of girls living together at Brangwyn ,  a boarding school .  A new student arrives ,  Ernessa (Lily Cole) and the girls begin to suspect that she is a vampire .  Harron has described the film as a ""gothic coming-of-age story"" that explores the nuanced friendships of teenage girls as they are repeatedly confronted with the prospect of adulthood .  This Gothic horror feature entangles teenage experiences of sexuality ,  close female friendships ,  and drama with supernatural elements . The film was shot in and around Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada .  It is a Canada-Ireland co-production as Harron worked with Irish production company Samson Films' David Collins . Harron directed the 2018 independent film Charlie Says ,  with a screenplay by Turner ,  which tells the real-life story of how three of Charles Manson's female followers (Susan Atkins ,  Patricia Krenwinkel ,  and Leslie Van Houten) came to terms with the magnitude of their crimes while incarcerated in the 1970s .  Matt Smith played Manson in flashbacks .  The film had initially been intended for another director ,  but when that director was no longer available Harron took over .  Harron stated that she was fascinated by the psychological aspects of how the women ended up committing murder as a result of both manipulation by Manson and feelings of solidarity with one another . In addition to her films ,  Harron was also the executive producer of The Weather Underground ,  a documentary looking at the Weathermen (political activists and extremists of the 1970s) .  She has also worked in television ,  directing episodes of Oz ,  Six Feet Under ,  Homicide :  Life on the Street ,  The L Word and Big Love .  Working on the episode of Six Feet Under ""The Rainbow of Her Reasons"" ,  Harron was brought back together with I Shot Andy Warhol actress ,  Lili Taylor .   "
